    "description": "The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. The northbound travel lane was\n                        controlled by a stop sign. Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday. The\n                        posted speed limit was 35 MPH and both roads were level.\n\n\n                        V1 was a 2002 Mazda 323 hatchback traveling northbound in the right lane approaching an\n                        intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight. V2, a 1997 Nissan Maxima\n                        sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching the intersection intending on going\n                        straight. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2. V1 came to final rest facing northeast.\n                        V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.\n\n\n                        V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male who was not injured. He stated that he was stopped at the\n                        stop sign, looked in both directions, then proceeded thru the intersection but saw V2 in the\n                        corner of his eye. The driver of V1 braked and swerved right but was unable to avoid contact\n                        with V2. V1 was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH at the time of impact. V1 was towed due to\n                        damage.\n\n\n                        The critical precrash event for V1 was this vehicle traveling, crossing over intersection. The\n                        critical reason for the critical precrash event was an illegal maneuver, failure to stop/yield.\n                        No associated factors were coded to this driver.\n\n\n                        V2 was driven by a 20-year-old pregnant female who sustained moderate injuries and was\n                        transported to a local hospital. She stated that she was traveling eastbound and saw V1 run the\n                        stop sign. She then beeped but V1 struck her on the right. V2 was traveling between 31 and 40\n                        MPH at the time of impact. The driver of V2 did not take any avoidance actions. V2 was towed due\n                        to damage.\n\n\n                        The critical precrash event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across\n                        path. The critical reason for the critical precrash event was not coded to this vehicle."

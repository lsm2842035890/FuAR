    "description": "The crash occurred at the T-intersection of an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road\n                        and a north/south two-lane local road. The arterial curves to the south (left) as it approaches\n                        the intersection from the east with a radius of curvature of 375m. Traffic counts indicate it\n                        carries 9,036 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph). The local road is\n                        straight and is controlled by a stop sign with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph). Conditions were\n                        daylight and dry on a weekday morning.\n\n\n                        Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with four horses westbound on\n                        the two lane arterial road. Vehicle #2, a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound on the local road.\n                        Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn to go east when its left side was struck by the front\n                        of Vehicle #1. After impact the F-250 (V1) rotated counterclockwise and jackknifed with the\n                        truck coming to rest partially off the south side of the intersection facing southeast. The\n                        trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest. The Corolla (V2) rotated\n                        clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.\n\n\n                        Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not\n                        injured in the crash. She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the\n                        other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection. However, she didn't believe the\n                        Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance. Once she realized Vehicle #2 was\n                        beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt\n                        to avoid a collision.\n\n\n                        The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was other vehicle encroaching from crossing street\n                        turning into opposite direction. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to\n                        this vehicle. There were no associated factors for Vehicle #1.\n\n\n                        Vehicle #2 was operated by a 46-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags.\n                        She had minor injuries but was not transported for treatment. She indicated that she stopped at\n                        the stop sign, looked both ways but didn't see Vehicle #2 approaching. She believes she may have\n                        pulled out into the intersection slowly because of a reduced size spare tire present on the\n                        right rear of the vehicle that made her uncomfortable.\n\n\n                        The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was this vehicle turning left at intersection. The\n                        Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a recognition error, inadequate surveillance. An\n                        Associated factor was an other driver related experience factor; she was uncomfortable with the\n                        spare tire on the vehicle. She also wore corrective lenses for a farsighted condition."

    "description": "This 2-vehicle crash occurred within a \"T\" type intersection in a rural area during\n                        daylight hours while raining. The straight three-lane east/westbound roadway included a center\n                        left turn lane and was on a slight downhill grade for westbound traffic. The straight two-lane\n                        north/southbound roadway was on a steeper downhill grade for southbound traffic and was\n                        controlled by a stop sign. Both roadways were asphalt constructed and wet at the time of the\n                        crash. The speed limit for the through roadway was 80 kph (50 mph).\n\n\n                        Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero sedan driven by a 20 year-old female with one\n                        passenger was traveling southbound beginning a left hand turn (eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a\n                        1995 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup driven by a 66 year-old male was traveling westbound in the #1 lane\n                        when the driver saw V1 beginning to pull out from the side street. The driver of V2 tapped on\n                        his brakes and steered left slightly but could not avoid V1 because of oncoming traffic. The\n                        front of V2 struck the front of V1. At impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing\n                        north off the right side of the traffic lane in the intersection. V2 came to rest in the center\n                        turn lane facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene after the flat\n                        tire was changed.\n\n\n                        The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; turning left at\n                        intersection. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V1 as a driver\n                        related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). The\n                        driver was not aware of V2's presence until she had already entered the intersection. The driver\n                        was inattentive due to thinking about financial problems. An illegal maneuver was coded as an\n                        associative factor due to ignoring the traffic control. This driver slowed to approximately 5\n                        mph before entering the intersection and attempting a left turn. If she had stopped at the stop\n                        sign she may have detected V2 before entering the intersection.\n\n\n                        The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street,\n                        turning into opposite direction. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle."

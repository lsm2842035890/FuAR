Conditions were daylight and dry and EMS was dispatched in the early evening of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and a 1% uphill grade.V1 was a 2002 Lexus RX 300 SUV that was initially traveling before coming to a complete stop at the intersection and intending on turning left.  V2 was a 1994 Ford Taurus sedan directly in back of V2 intending on going straight.  The driver of V2 was looking to the left then looked straight ahead.  V2 tried to steer left and brake to avoid V1.  The front of V2 struck the back of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing west."

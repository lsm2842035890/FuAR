    "description": "This motor vehicle crash happened on a roadway.  This roadway travels east/west, with two travel lanes westbound and two travel lanes and one left turn lane eastbound.  The roadway is not physically divided.  The crash took place mid-block about 9 meters west of the traffic control signal.The driver of V1 was stopped at a traffic light, when the light turned green the driver proceeded to accelerate, traveling in lane two, in the westbound lanes.  V2 entered the roadway from a parking lot and crossed the path of V1, trying to turn onto the eastbound lanes.  V1 contacted V2 with its left front.  Both cars came to rest at impact.  V1's driver was coming from work and states that they did not see V2 until V2 crossed the path of V1.  The driver states that they were traveling about 40-48 kmph (25-30 mph) at time the of impact and tried to avoid contacting V2 but could not stop in time."

    "description": "     The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a three-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dark with lights, dry with cloudy skies in the evening on a weekday.  The westbound lanes had a posted speed of 80 kmph (50 mph), the southbound lane had a speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 1998 Ford Escort sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection with a stop sign.  V2, a 1993 Subaru Legacy sedan, was traveling westbound in the right lane approaching the T-intersection.  V1 made a left turn at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing westbound.  "

    "description": "\tThis crash occurred in the evening, the weather that evening was clear with no adverse conditions, the roadway was dry.  It took place on a major highway.  The highway travels east/west.  It consists of six total travel lanes, three in each direction, divided by a physical median with a positive barrier.  The two vehicles contacted in the westbound lanes while coming off the on-ramp, the on-ramp was not a factor (they were both on the roadway at the bottom).  The on-ramp had a yield sign at the bottom where the roadway levels out.\tV2 was stopped at the bottom of the on-ramp waiting for traffic at the yield sign.  V1 was also trying to merge into traffic, but did not notice V2 stopped at the bottom of the ramp due to being distracted by traffic on the roadway, driver of V1 was trying to merge into.  After V1 contacted the rear of V2 with its' front they both came to rest in the merging traffic lane.\tThe operator of V1 states that he thought the operator of V2 had already merged into traffic. Driver of V1 was paying attention to the other traffic and never saw that V2 had not merged into traffic as he had thought.  V1 rear- ended V2 at the bottom of the ramp.  "

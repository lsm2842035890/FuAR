        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent private driveway.  Conditions were dusk and dry with cloudy skies at 4:38 pm on a weekday late afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "   This crash took place on a two lane undivided roadway near a T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies shortly after noon on a weekend.  The roadway had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).   V1, a 1997 Chevrolet 300 conversion van, was traveling east on the roadway.  V2, a 1999 Infinity QX sport utility vehicle, was traveling west on the same roadway.  The vehicle traveling directly in front of V1 slowed quickly and to avoid making contact, the driver of V1 steered left, made a lane departure to the left, and this vehicle's right front made contact to the front right of V2.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was when it traveled over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as an incorrect evasive action. One associated factor coded to the driver of V1 was inattention. He reported that he had been thinking about some concerns immediately before the crash. V1 was driven by a 60 year-old male who was not injured.  V1 was towed due to damage.  The critical pre-crash event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle encroached into her lane from the opposite direction-over the left lane line. The critical reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and no associated factors were coded to her. V2 was driven by a 42 year-old female who was not injured.  V2 was also towed due to damage."

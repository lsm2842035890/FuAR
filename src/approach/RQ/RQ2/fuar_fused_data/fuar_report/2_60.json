The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes (two lanes head east and one heads west) of a three lane undivided, straight roadway in an urban-like setting where the posted speed limit is 48kmph (30mph).  The roadway was dry and the weather was clear. This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.V1, a 1991 Chrysler New Yorker, was traveling east when it stopped in lane two (the left turn lane) awaiting traffic to pass before turning into a fast food restaurant.  V2, a 1990 Nissan Pick-up, truck was leaving a service station on the east side of the road.V2 was waived out of the lot by the driver of an uninvolved vehicle stopped in lane one of the roadway.  As V2 proceeded out of the lot it was struck by the front left of V1.  The driver and a passenger of V1 were transported to an area hospital, treated and released. Another passenger in V1 was not injured. The driver of V2 was not injured."

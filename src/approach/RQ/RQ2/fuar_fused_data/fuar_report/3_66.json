        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dusk and dry in the evening on a weekend.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and the eastbound lane had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Hyundai Elantra sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection.  V2, a 1998 Ford Taurus sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left.  V2 stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions but there was landscaping and a fence obstructing V2's view.  V2 then proceeded to turn left and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in the intersection., as V1 passed by V2, V2's right front contacted the back of V1.  V1 continued on and struck a curb and a tree.  V1 came to final rest facing eastbound.  V2 continued on and struck a curb and came to final rest facing northwest.",
        "This crash occurred on an urban intersection and involved two vehicles.  The crash occurred at a T-intersection. Traffic approaching the intersection traveling northbound is controlled by a stop sign located at the southeast corner of the intersection.  The weather at the time of the crash was clear.  The speed limit on the east/west through street, which has one lane in each direction and is undivided,  is posted 64 kmph (40 mph).  The speed limit on the north/south cross street, which also has one lane in each direction and is undivided, is posted 40 kmph (25 mph).  Vehicle one (V1) was a 2001 Toyota Tacoma 2wd pickup truck that was stopped facing north at the stop sign.  Vehicle two (V2) was a 1998 Honda Accord 4 door sedan. V2 was traveling E/B on the through street, which is a two-lane dry level, asphalt roadway, in the number one lane.  V1 was stopped for approximately 10 seconds on the intersecting roadway in the number one lane waiting to turn left.  A non-contact vehicle that wasforward of V2 but in the same lane as V2, made a right turn onto the street that V1 was stopped on.  There was a sight line restriction for the drivers of V1 and V2 created by the non-contact vehicle turning right.  The driver of V1 began to make a left turn onto the through street into path of V2.  The front of V1 impacted with V2's right front corner. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise coming to rest facing east in the eastbound number one eastbound travel lane facing east. V2 moved forward after impact and also came to rest in the number one eastbound travel lane facing east.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene.The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.   The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view. The driver looked but did not see V2 prior to impact. The sight line was blocked by the non-contact vehicle turning right onto the cross street. ",
        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a T-intersection with a grass median.  There was one northbound left-turn only lane with a traffic control and two eastbound lanes with the same traffic control signal.  Conditions were overcast with rain with light fog in the early afternoon of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 45 MPH.     Vehicle 1 was a 1988 Mercedes Benz 300SL stopped for the traffic control intending on turning left.  Vehicle 2 was a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer driving eastbound in the right lane approaching the traffic control.  The light for the Mercedes turned green and the vehicle started turning left when the front of the Mercury struck the left-front corner of the Mercedes.  The Mercedes rotated CCW 90 degrees and the vehicle's final rest was facing east in the eastbound lane.  Final rest for the Mercury was facing east in the eastbound lane as well. "

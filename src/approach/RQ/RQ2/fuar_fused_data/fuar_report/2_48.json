        "     The crash occurred on a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 KMPH (55 MPH).  The roadway was curved with a radius of curvature of 563 meters and a superelevation of 2.8%.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1992 Toyota 4-Runner, was traveling south on the two-lane roadway negotiating the curve to the right.  Vehicle #2, a 2005 Freightliner School Bus, was traveling north on the same roadway negotiating the curve to the left.  Vehicle #1 crossed the centerline into the northbound lane.  Vehicle #2 attempted to steer right onto the paved shoulder to avoid the collision.  Vehicle #1 continued across the northbound lane onto the paved shoulder and struck Vehicle #2's front with its front.  Vehicle #1 came to rest facing in a southeasterly direction on the east shoulder and Vehicle #2 came to rest facing in a northerly direction.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.     The Toyota 4-Runner (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 27 year old male who received minor bruises, but refused medical treatment.  He stated that as he was negotiating the curve at approximately 64-72 KMPH (40-45 MPH), when his truck pulled to the left and he thought it might have been a wind gust.  He attempted to steer back into his lane, but the steering wheel would not turn.  He was unable to return to his lane and continued to drift into the opposing lane.  He observed the bus coming toward him, but was only able to brake in an attempt to avoid the collision.  The truck left approximately 17 meters of pre-impact skids.  The police issued him a citation for failure to keep right.  He stated that he took no medications and did not wear corrective lenses.  He indicated that he had gotten off work early and was not in a hurry. "

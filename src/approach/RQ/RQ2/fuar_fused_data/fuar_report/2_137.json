        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon near a crossover of a multi-lane highway divided by a grass median. The southbound side had three lanes including a left-turn lane; the northbound side had four lanes that included a right and left turn lane at a T-intersection. The posted speed limit for both directions was 89 kmph (55 mph) and weather conditions were cloudy and dry.V1, a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier driven by a 17-year old male, was traveling south in lane three approaching the T-intersection. V2, a 1995 Honda Accord driven by a 32-year old female, was traveling north in lane 3 approaching the same intersection. V1 entered the crossover area and then initiated a left turn. As V1 crossed into the northbound lanes, it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. V1 came to final rest in northeast roadside of the intersection and V2 came to rest in the same lane it was originally traveling. The driver of V1 was returning home from work and was attempting to make a left turn when he turned in front of the Honda Accord. He reported that there were other vehicles obstructing his view of oncoming traffic but he decided to turn left anyway. He said he never saw the Honda that struck him so he never tried to avoid the collision. He was not injured in the crash.",
        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were dark with minimal lighting in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).  The northbound lane had a  >2% uphill grade.  The southbound lane was level.     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Corolla sedan traveling northbound in the third travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2006 Chevy Colorado pickup, was traveling southbound in the 2nd travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     V1 was driven by a 51-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  He stated that he did not see V2.  The driver did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

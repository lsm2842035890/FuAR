        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction and a one-way roadway with one lane of travel.  The roadway was straight and level, and had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device; the southbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. It was dark but lighted, and clear with no adverse conditions.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Lexus SC430 traveling eastbound on the two-way roadway and Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Lexus LS400 traveling south on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right side of Vehicle #2.  The front of Vehicle #1 then impacted a light-pole on the southeast corner of the intersection.  The Lexus SC430 (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 45-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 ran the stop sign and caused him to impact Vehicle #2 and then into the light-pole.  He stated that he did not perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The Lexus SC430 was towed due to damage.  ",
        "       The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane intersection controlled by a stop sign.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).     V1 was a 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis sedan traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2, a 2003 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane intending on going straight.  V1 stopped at the stop sign looked both ways but did not see V2.  The front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing northbound and V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he stopped at the stop sign, looked both ways and proceeded thru the intersection.  He did not see V2 at all.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage."

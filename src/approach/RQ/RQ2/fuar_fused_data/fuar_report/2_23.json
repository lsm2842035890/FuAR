        "\tThe crash occurred in the early evening hours while still daylight at a T-intersection.  The main street was an east/west two-lane two-way roadway with no traffic control. The posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). The crossing street ran north/south and ended at the T-intersection.  The north/south roadway was a two-lane two-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The east west roadway had a shoulder on either side, which diminished as it neared the intersection.  The roadway was divided by two solid yellow lines.  There were no adverse weather conditions that day and both roadways were dry.   \tV1, a 1998 Ford Taurus station wagon, was driven by a 20-year old female. V1 was traveling west on the east/west roadway. V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 24-year old female. V2 was traveling south on the north/south roadway. According to police and witness reports, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop at her stop sign, facing south.  The driver of V2 then entered the intersection and attempted to turn left to travel east on the east/west roadway.  As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1. The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.  V1 rolled off of the sidewalk and came to rest facing south in the middle of the two east/west lanes.\tThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as \"other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.\" The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to V1, although excess speed was coded as an associated factor. A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact. The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). All other information was unknown due to the lack of an interview with the driver of V1.",
        "This is a two-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area at a \"T\" type intersection.  The east and westbound 2-lane asphalt roadway is straight, level and is the through street.  The north and southbound 2-lane asphalt roadway is straight, level and is controlled by a stop sign where it dead-ends at the through street.  The speed limit for the through street is 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or road conditions.Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 GMC Jimmy was southbound turning left (east) following a non-contact vehicle that had turned left at the intersection.  Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero was westbound when its front bumper plane contacted the left side plane of V1.  V1 rolled to rest on the dirt shoulder of the through street facing east.  V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing south.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The driver of V1, a seventeen-year old female was heading from her aunts home back to her house.  This driver was in a hurry as she needed to get home, get some clothes and go back to school for pictures.  This driver had been driving for about fifteen minutes at the time of the crash.  This driver stated that she was on an unknown medication for acne, but the medical records did not indicate any medications.  This driver stated that she stopped behind a non-contact vehicle.  This driver stated that she looked both ways but did not see V2.  She was eating while driving and had been thinking about a future event. This driver drives this vehicle daily and over this road on a weekly basis."

        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were cloudy with rain in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH.  The northbound lane had a -3% downhill grade.  The southbound lane had a positive 2 % uphill grade.     V1 was a 1995 Mercedes Benz S420 sedan traveling northbound in the first travel lane negotiating a curve left.  V2, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was traveling southbound in the first travel lane about to negotiate the curve.  V1 lost control of her vehicle and began to spin in a counterclockwise rotation.  V1 crossed over the centerline and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast.  V2 came to final rest facing easr-southeast.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was not injured.  She refused to be interviewed but a surrogate interview was obtained by the investigating police officer.  He stated that the driver of V1 was speeding while negotiating the curve, which caused the driver to lose control on the wet pavement.  V1 then spun counterclockwise and crossed over the centerline and struck V2.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 31 and 40 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight with a downhill grade of -2/61.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.  The speed limit for the roadway was 48kmph (30mph).  On the right of the southbound lanes was a gas station and a carwash. Vehicle # 1 was a 1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT, that was traveling southbound on the right lane.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1996 Ford Windstar that was traveling northbound on the left lane and attempting to turn left into the Gas Station.  Due to a sightline restriction from a non-contact vehicle, the front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the right-front wheel of Vehicle # 2.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was driven by a 40-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 25 mph when a mini-van traveling northbound attempted to make a left-turn.  The driver stated that he tried to brake but it was too late because his sightline was restricted by another vehicle on the left-lane.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was not towed due to damage. "

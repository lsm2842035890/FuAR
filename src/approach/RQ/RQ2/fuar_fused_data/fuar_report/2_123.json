        "This crash occurred in the left lane of a one-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was dark but lighted and the roadway had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 2 was a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara that was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and slowed down for an emergency fire truck with the emergency lights and sirens attempting to go eastbound on a two-way roadway.  Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.  The Lincoln Navigator (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 27-year old male who sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  The Lincoln was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  The northbound travel lane was controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH and both roads were level.     V1 was a 2002 Mazda 323 hatchback traveling northbound in the right lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 1997 Nissan Maxima sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching the intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing northeast.  V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he was stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions, then proceeded thru the intersection but saw V2 in the corner of his eye.  The driver of V1 braked and swerved right but was unable to avoid contact with V2.  V1 was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

        "This crash occurred in the left lane of a one-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was dark but lighted and the roadway had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 2 was a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara that was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and slowed down for an emergency fire truck with the emergency lights and sirens attempting to go eastbound on a two-way roadway.  Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.  The Lincoln Navigator (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 27-year old male who sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  The Lincoln was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the evening hours in the middle of the two northbound lanes of a physically divided (concrete barrier) bridge.  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, although it was dark and no streetlights were present.  The roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of the roadway was 72kph (45mph).  V1, a 2005 Mazda 626, was northbound in lane one on the bridge.  V2, a 1995 Ford Windstar, was disabled on the bridge in lane one ahead of vehicle one.  V1 failed to stop and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2 the impact pushed V2 forward and its right side contacted the right concrete barrier before coming to final rest.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to vehicle damage.V1 was driven by a 22 year-old female who suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision, but did not require transport to a medical facility.  After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of vehicle one.  From statements given to the police on scene the driver of V1 had consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the crash but sobriety tests confirmed she was still within the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.  V1 was towed due to damage."

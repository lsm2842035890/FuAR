        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. The roadway was not physically divided, and there was no traffic control device involved in this crash.  The conditions were as follows: early morning, clear skies, and the roadway was dry.  The gradient for the two vehicles involved was level.  The posted speed limit for the two vehicles was 56 kmph (35mph).  Vehicle one (V1) was a 2000 Chevy Blazer, traveling westbound.  V1 was driven by a 38-year old male. V1 traveled over the double yellow line to the left into opposing traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford Taurus, was traveling eastbound.  V2 was driven by a 17-year old male. The left front of V1 struck the left side of V2, pulling the outside of the left front door off.  The police report narrative indicated that after striking V2, V1 left the scene. V1 was pulled over by police shortly after the crash, and the driver of V1 told police that he thought he had hit a curb. Police indicated that the driver of V1 was unsteady on his feet, confused, and lethargic. An ambulance arrived on scene and tested his blood sugar, which was normal.

        "\tThe crash occurred at a T-intersection of an eastbound 5-lane undivided roadway and a northbound driveway exit from a parking lot.  The eastbound roadway was a two-way, five-lane roadway with a two-way left turn lane in the middle.  Both the eastbound roadway and the driveway were straight, level, bituminous roadways.   The posted speed for east/west traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph).  Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies.  Traffic flow in the eastbound direction was backed up for a light at a signalized intersection up ahead.    \tV1, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was stopped at a stop sign at the parking lot exit, waiting to turn left.  V2, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in the two-way left turn lane.  Traffic in the first two eastbound lanes was backed up for a traffic light ahead.  Vehicles in those lanes made space for V1 to pull out.  As V1 pulled out to turn left, the front of V1 made contact with the front of V2 in the third (middle) lane of travel.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.   \tV1 was driven by a 23-year old female who sustained possible injuries.  She was transported to the hospital from the crash scene by her boyfriend.  She stated that she had stopped at the drug store on her way to the hospice to see her grandmother.  Eastbound traffic was backed up, but the first two lanes left a gap for her to exit.  She said that one of the drivers waved her out.  She stated that she didn't see anything, so she cautiously pulled out.  The driver indicated that she did not know where the other vehicle came from.    "

It was raining, the roadway was wet and it was daylight at the time of this weekday morning crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1998 Ford Contour, was traveling west exiting a parking lot driveway controlled by a flashing red light.  Vehicle #2, a 2000 Dodge Durango, was traveling north in the second lane of the main road approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #1 entered the intersection to turn left and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle #2.  Vehicle #1 was rotated counterclockwise, across the southbound lanes and came to rest off the road facing in a southeasterly direction.  Vehicle #2 drove off the road to the right and stopped in a parking lot.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Ford Contour (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 69 year old female who was transported, treated for fractured ribs and released from a local hospital.  She stated that she had just left the feed store and was waiting to pull out to make a left hand turn.  She indicated that she had been stopped for more than 10 seconds prior to proceeding and waited until other traffic had a red light as she always did.  She stated that other vehicles had stopped, but the vehicle that hit her didn't. She stated she wore glasses for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighted) conditions. She had a hearing deficiency and was wearing a hearing aid at the time of the crash.  She considered herself in fair health.",

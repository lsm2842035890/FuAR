        "     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH). The roadway for Vehicle #2 was slightly curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 1,125 meters. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty, was traveling north in the second straight/left turn lane approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 Mazda 626, was traveling south in the right hand lane approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles had a green light. Vehicle #1 stopped waiting for traffic to clear prior to making the left hand turn.  Vehicle #1 proceeded to make the left turn and struck Vehicle #2 in its front with front.  Vehicle #1 drove off the road into a driveway.  Vehicle #2 continued a short distance and came to rest facing in a southerly direction in its original lane.  Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Dodge Dynasty (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 71 year old female who had a bruise to her right forearm from the deployed airbag, but refused treatment.  She stated that she was on an errand for her grandson at her anticipated destination.  She stated that she had stopped waiting for traffic to clear before making the left, thought she had a green light at the time as she made the turn.  As she proceeded to make the turn, she indicated that she saw the other vehicle \"out of the corner of her eye\" at the last second, but the other vehicle was \"right there\" and she was unable to avoid the crash. She also stated that she had just accelerated from a stop and was traveling no more than 5-10 MPH.  She indicated that the other vehicle was traveling pretty fast and that she never saw her until she was right there.",
        "    The crash occurred on at a T-intersection of a four lane arterial road and a two-lane residential side street.  The urban four-lane roadway ran east/west and was undivided with two way left turn lane.   The two lane residential side street went north/south and was controlled by a stop sign.  Both roads were straight and level.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Chevy Blazer northbound attempting to turn left from the residential side street to go west on the four-lane road.  Vehicle #2, a 2001 Nissan Sentra, was eastbound in the left lane of the four-lane road.  The GMC (V1) began to turn left into the center two way left turn lane and stopped in the eastbound lanes.  The front of the Nissan (V2) struck the left side of Vehicle #1.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 20-year-old male that was belted and not injured in the crash.  The front right passenger, a 21-year-old female, was belted and transported to an area hospital with minor injuries.  No airbags deployed.  It appears the driver misjudged the gap distance and panicked when he realized he couldn't make it across to the center turn lane, stopping in the eastbound lanes."

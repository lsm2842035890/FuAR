        "     This crash occurred on a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 64KPH (40MPH).  There was an intersecting roadway to the left and a driveway to the right. There was a traffic control signal at the intersection. The weather was cloudy, the roadway was dry and it was dark, but lighted at the time of this late night weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1987 Honda Accord, was traveling south on the two lane undivided roadway approaching the intersection. It should be noted that the traffic control signal was lighted red. Vehicle #2, a 1994 Honda Civic was stopped at the signal awaiting a green light, in front of Vehicle #1. Vehicle #1's front impacted Vehicle #2's rear. Vehicle #2 was pushed through the intersection and came to rest facing in a southwesterly direction. Vehicle #1 came to rest facing in a southerly direction.     The Honda Accord (Vehicle #1) was driven by an unbelted 19 year old female who was transported, treated and released for minor bleeding to the head. She stated that she did not see the other vehicle, that she was also looking down to retrieve a dropped water bottle as well as attempting to put on her seat belt. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage and was destroyed before the inspection could be done.",
        "     The crash occurred on a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 55 MPH (89 KPH).  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of the crash.     Vehicle 1, a 1996 Honda Civic, was traveling east on the roadway behind Vehicle 2, a 2002 GMC Envoy.  Vehicle 2 observes a non-contact vehicle in front of it slowing to make a left into a driveway.  Vehicle 2 decelerates and is struck in the rear by the front of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 is pushed forward and drives off the road to the right coming to rest facing east off the south shoulder.  V1 came to rest facing east off the south shoulder.Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage and Vehicle 2 was driven from the scene.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.",
        "This two vehicle crash occurred during early evening hours at a T-intersection during dusk, rush hour traffic.  There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of this crash.  The bituminous roadway was dry.  The south roadway  level, undivided, two-way traffic way controlled by a stop sign. The west roadway has a positive 8% sloped, undivided, 5-lane traffic way, with no traffic controls. Posted speed limit 56 kmph (35 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a  2004, 4-door Chrysler Sebring driven by a 44 year-old female with one passenger was stopped at the stop sign for several minutes in the curb lane waiting to turn left across the westbound and center 2-way left turn lane.  Vehicle two (V2), a  1996 4-door Dodge Intrepid driven by a 33 year-old male was approaching the T-intersection in lane 2 going straight.  V1 proceeded its left turn across westbound lanes and its front collided with the front of V2.  V1's left front corner contacted the right front corner of V2.  The force of the impact caused V1 to rotate at least 90 degrees clockwise and it came to final rest in lanes one and two of the westbound travel lanes.  After the first impact V2 traveled southwest across the center 2-way lane and two eastbound lanes.  V2 came to final rest on top of the south curb edge and sidewalk of the traffic way.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view.  A non-contact large truck in the number one eastbound travel lane obstructed the view of V2, which was in the number two adjacent eastbound lane, for the driver of V1.  Associative factor driver of V1 may have been upset due to recent divorce, maybe fatigue due to spending most of the day shopping for household furniture brought on by a recent divorce.  The driver had been frustrated waiting at the stop sign to turn left and proceeded to turn left when her passenger said traffic to the right was clear."

The posted speed limit for vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was a 2005 Toyota Tundra, traveling southbound. V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper. The driver side airbags for V1 inflated, and the driver was wearing his seatbelt. The impact caused V1 to push V2 further down the roadway. V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was able to be driven from the scene. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as other motor vehicle in lane and was stopped.

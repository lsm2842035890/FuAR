        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were dark with minimal lighting in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).  The northbound lane had a  >2% uphill grade.  The southbound lane was level.     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Corolla sedan traveling northbound in the third travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2006 Chevy Colorado pickup, was traveling southbound in the 2nd travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     V1 was driven by a 51-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  He stated that he did not see V2.  The driver did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  It was mid-morning and heavy rain was present.  The gradient for both roadways of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 travel were level.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 64 kmph (40mph).V1, a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire operated by a 18-year-old male, was traveling westbound.  V2, a 2003 Hyundai Elantra operated by a 24-year-old male, was traveling eastbound.  V1 crossed the centerline, entered the eastbound lane, and impacted V2 head-on.  The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise; V1 came to final rest in the westbound lane facing south.  The driver of V2 was initially traveling straight and then attempted to avoid the collision by steering the vehicle to the right.  V2 rotated clockwise before coming to final rest between a mailbox and telephone pole.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by EMS to a local hospital.  After obtaining the interview from the driver of V1, it is likely that work and sleep patterns contributed to this crash. The driver was traveling home after working the graveyard shift.  ",
        "\tV1, a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup, was traveling eastbound on a three-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions.  V1 was approaching a T-intersection intending to turn right.  V2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling southbound on a four-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway approaching the same intersection.  V2 was intending to go straight.  The posted speed for both roadways was 89 kmph (55 mph). Eastbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign; south and northbound traffic had no traffic control device. V1 stopped at the stop sign for 10 seconds or more.  V1 then made a right-hand turn.  The front of V2 contacted the left of V1 before they both came to final rest in the roadway.\tThe driver of V1 was a 68-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to the store.  He did not wear corrective lenses.  He was uninjured in the crash and refused treatment.  \tThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning right at intersection.  The Critical reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a recognition error: inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see) because he stated that he had looked both ways but did not see V2.",
        "\tThe crash occurred at a T-intersection of an eastbound 5-lane undivided roadway and a northbound driveway exit from a parking lot.  The eastbound roadway was a two-way, five-lane roadway with a two-way left turn lane in the middle.  Both the eastbound roadway and the driveway were straight, level, bituminous roadways.   The posted speed for east/west traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph).  Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies.  Traffic flow in the eastbound direction was backed up for a light at a signalized intersection up ahead.    \tV1, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was stopped at a stop sign at the parking lot exit, waiting to turn left.  V2, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in the two-way left turn lane.  Traffic in the first two eastbound lanes was backed up for a traffic light ahead.  Vehicles in those lanes made space for V1 to pull out.  As V1 pulled out to turn left, the front of V1 made contact with the front of V2 in the third (middle) lane of travel.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.   \tV1 was driven by a 23-year old female who sustained possible injuries.  She was transported to the hospital from the crash scene by her boyfriend.  She stated that she had stopped at the drug store on her way to the hospice to see her grandmother.  Eastbound traffic was backed up, but the first two lanes left a gap for her to exit.  She said that one of the drivers waved her out.  She stated that she didn't see anything, so she cautiously pulled out.  The driver indicated that she did not know where the other vehicle came from.    "

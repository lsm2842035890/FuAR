        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a driveway related intersection.  Conditions were daylight in the morning on a weekend.  The posted speed limit for the northbound lane was 35 MPH.  There was no posted speed limit for the driveway.     V1 was a 2001 Buick Century sedan turning left out of the driveway facing westbound.  V2, a 2005 Toyota Tundra pick-up, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the driveway intending on going straight.  V1 made a left turn and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northbound.     V1 was driven by a 76-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  She stated that prior to exiting the driveway, she looked both ways and couldn't see to her left because of a big sign.  She proceeded to turn left and struck V2.  V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling less than 10 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

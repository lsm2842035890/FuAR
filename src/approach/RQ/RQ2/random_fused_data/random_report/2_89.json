        "\tThe crash occurred in the early evening hours while still daylight at a T-intersection.  The main street was an east/west two-lane two-way roadway with no traffic control. The posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). The crossing street ran north/south and ended at the T-intersection.  The north/south roadway was a two-lane two-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The east west roadway had a shoulder on either side, which diminished as it neared the intersection.  The roadway was divided by two solid yellow lines.  There were no adverse weather conditions that day and both roadways were dry.   \tV1, a 1998 Ford Taurus station wagon, was driven by a 20-year old female. V1 was traveling west on the east/west roadway. V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 24-year old female. V2 was traveling south on the north/south roadway. According to police and witness reports, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop at her stop sign, facing south.  The driver of V2 then entered the intersection and attempted to turn left to travel east on the east/west roadway.  As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1. The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.  V1 rolled off of the sidewalk and came to rest facing south in the middle of the two east/west lanes.\tThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as \"other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.\" The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to V1, although excess speed was coded as an associated factor. A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact. The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). All other information was unknown due to the lack of an interview with the driver of V1.",
        "    The crash occurred on at a T-intersection of a four lane arterial road and a two-lane residential side street.  The urban four-lane roadway ran east/west and was undivided with two way left turn lane.   The two lane residential side street went north/south and was controlled by a stop sign.  Both roads were straight and level.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Chevy Blazer northbound attempting to turn left from the residential side street to go west on the four-lane road.  Vehicle #2, a 2001 Nissan Sentra, was eastbound in the left lane of the four-lane road.  The GMC (V1) began to turn left into the center two way left turn lane and stopped in the eastbound lanes.  The front of the Nissan (V2) struck the left side of Vehicle #1.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 20-year-old male that was belted and not injured in the crash.  The front right passenger, a 21-year-old female, was belted and transported to an area hospital with minor injuries.  No airbags deployed.  It appears the driver misjudged the gap distance and panicked when he realized he couldn't make it across to the center turn lane, stopping in the eastbound lanes."

All roadways were straight and level and had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  The northbound entrance into the intersection was controlled by a stop sign.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.V1, a 1998 Mercedes-Benz ML320, was traveling westbound approaching the intersection.  V2, a 1999 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling northbound and stopped at the stop sign.  As V2 proceeded into the intersection, its front impacted the left side of V1.  V1 than yawed counterclockwise and the right-rear wheel impacted the curb.  The right side of V1 then impacted a breakaway light-pole and rolled over one quarter turn before coming to final rest on its right side.V1 was driven by a 35 year-old male who sustained minor injuries and was transported to a medical facility.   A complete interview could not be obtained, but the driver stated that he was going straight when he was impacted by V2, who did not stop at the stop sign.  The Mercedes-Benz was towed due to damage.",

        "\tThis crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the eastbound lanes of an urban roadway near a T-intersection.  The east/west roadway consisted of two through lanes flanked by a designated right turn lane and a designated left turn lane in the eastbound direction and two through lanes in the westbound direction.  The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph).  Traffic was congested, but flowing and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.\tV1, a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette two-door with one occupant was eastbound in lane three.  V2, a 1990 Buick Regal two-door with one occupant was stopped eastbound in lane three ahead of V1 waiting for the light at the intersection ahead of him to turn green and traffic to proceed.  As light turned green and V2 began to accelerate V1 struck V2's rear.  A witness stated that the driver of V1 was traveling between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph) when he made the avoidance action of steering right but could not avoid V2.  Both vehicles rolled forward and came to final rest near the point of impact.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  \tThe driver of V1, an unknown aged male, fled the scene shortly after maneuvering the vehicle off the road.  No further information could be obtained regarding the driver as the owner of the vehicle told the police it had been taken without him knowing."

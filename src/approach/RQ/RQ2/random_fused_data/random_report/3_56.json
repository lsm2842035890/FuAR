        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were cloudy with rain in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH.  The northbound lane had a -3% downhill grade.  The southbound lane had a positive 2 % uphill grade.     V1 was a 1995 Mercedes Benz S420 sedan traveling northbound in the first travel lane negotiating a curve left.  V2, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was traveling southbound in the first travel lane about to negotiate the curve.  V1 lost control of her vehicle and began to spin in a counterclockwise rotation.  V1 crossed over the centerline and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast.  V2 came to final rest facing easr-southeast.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was not injured.  She refused to be interviewed but a surrogate interview was obtained by the investigating police officer.  He stated that the driver of V1 was speeding while negotiating the curve, which caused the driver to lose control on the wet pavement.  V1 then spun counterclockwise and crossed over the centerline and struck V2.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 31 and 40 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",

Road surface dry asphalt, no adverse weather condition or sight restrictions. The posted speed limit 48 kMmph (30 mph). The east/west roadway has a +8% grade.Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Yamaha 600cc motorcycle driven by a 36 year-old male, was traveling west. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Ford Crown Victoria sedan driven by a 39 year-old male with three passengers, was traveling south in the process of making a left turn after stopping at a stop sign, As V2 entered the intersection V1, according to witnesses was driving at a high rate of speed, changed lanes to the left and collided with the left side of V2. The driver of V1 came to final rest at the northwest corner of the intersection and the motorcycle came to rest in the intersection at point of impact. V2 came to rest facing east in the westbound lanes. Both  V1 and V2 were towed from the scene, the driver of V1 was transported to a local medical facility.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle.  Associative factors for V 1 driver are as follows: driver performed various decision errors (aggressive driving behaviors).  V 1 driver violated a traffic signal, accelerated excessively  while weaving in and out of travel lanes, and failed to look far enough ahead for possible crossing traffic.  Medical reports indicated V1 driver  had an abnormal level of amphetamine."

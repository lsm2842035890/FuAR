        "The crash occurred in the intersection of two one-way roadways.  Both roadways had one lane of travel and were straight and level.  The speed limit was 48kmph (30mph) and it was clear with no adverse conditions.Vehicle # 1 was a 2005 Infiniti FX35 that was traveling southbound on a one-way roadway.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1993 Ford F-250 Pick-up truck that was traveling westbound on a one-way roadway, which was controlled by a stop sign.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the right side of Vehicle # 2, and then the left side of Vehicle # 2 impacted the right side of Vehicle # 1.  Vehicle # 1 then departed the roadway on the left side and then impacted a fence and came to a final rest after impacting the side of the building.The Infiniti FX35 (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 45 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver of this vehicle declined to participate in the study.  Vehicle # 1 was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were cloudy with rain in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH.  The northbound lane had a -3% downhill grade.  The southbound lane had a positive 2 % uphill grade.     V1 was a 1995 Mercedes Benz S420 sedan traveling northbound in the first travel lane negotiating a curve left.  V2, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was traveling southbound in the first travel lane about to negotiate the curve.  V1 lost control of her vehicle and began to spin in a counterclockwise rotation.  V1 crossed over the centerline and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast.  V2 came to final rest facing easr-southeast.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was not injured.  She refused to be interviewed but a surrogate interview was obtained by the investigating police officer.  He stated that the driver of V1 was speeding while negotiating the curve, which caused the driver to lose control on the wet pavement.  V1 then spun counterclockwise and crossed over the centerline and struck V2.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 31 and 40 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

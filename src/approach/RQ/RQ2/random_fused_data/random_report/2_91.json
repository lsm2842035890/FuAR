        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH (64KPH).  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash.     Vehicle #1, a 2002 Acura MDX, was parked off the right side of the roadway in an unimproved area used by a business for parking.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 GMC Vandura designated as a school bus, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway.  Vehicle #1 entered the roadway from the right into path of Vehicle #2 to execute an illegal U-turn.  Vehicle #2 braked and steered left to avoid a collision.  Vehicle #2 struck Vehicle #1 in left side with its front.  Vehicle #2 came to rest facing in a northwesterly direction.  Vehicle #1 was rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest facing in a northerly direction.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Acura MDX (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 51 year old male who was treated at the scene for a laceration to his arm.  He stated that he had stopped to pick up lunch for his co-workers and was going to make a U-turn to return to work.  He stated that he had glanced at the traffic light (behind him) and thought it was red.  He also stated that he had looked, but didn't see the bus.  He estimated that he was traveling less than 10 MPH at the time of impact and made no avoidance maneuvers.  Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a four-lane intersection controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the morning on a weekday.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph) and a 2% uphill grade. The westbound lane had a posted sped limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan stopped westbound at the stop sign in the first travel lane.  V2, a 2003 Nissan 350Z coupe, was traveling northbound in the second travel lane intending on going straight.  V1 was waved into the intersection by an unknown vehicle stopped in the 1st travel lane facing northbound.  V1 proceeded thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the 2nd travel lane of the northbound roadway.  The driver of V1 lost consciousness and his vehicle traveled southbound hitting a curb and several signs traveling approximately 115 meters.  V1 came to final rest against a pole facing westbound.  V2 came to final rest facing westbound.     V1 was driven by a 57-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  He stated that he was stopped at the stop sign when an unknown vehicle waved him into the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not see V2.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 18 and 32 kmph (11 and 20 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.  "

        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a four-lane intersection controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the morning on a weekday.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph) and a 2% uphill grade. The westbound lane had a posted sped limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan stopped westbound at the stop sign in the first travel lane.  V2, a 2003 Nissan 350Z coupe, was traveling northbound in the second travel lane intending on going straight.  V1 was waved into the intersection by an unknown vehicle stopped in the 1st travel lane facing northbound.  V1 proceeded thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the 2nd travel lane of the northbound roadway.  The driver of V1 lost consciousness and his vehicle traveled southbound hitting a curb and several signs traveling approximately 115 meters.  V1 came to final rest against a pole facing westbound.  V2 came to final rest facing westbound.     V1 was driven by a 57-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  He stated that he was stopped at the stop sign when an unknown vehicle waved him into the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not see V2.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 18 and 32 kmph (11 and 20 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.  ",
        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. It was not physically divided, and had a traffic-control device, for a construction zone.  The conditions were as follows: early afternoon, clear skies, the roadway was dry and there were no atmospheric conditions.  The gradient for the two vehicles involved were both on a +6% roadway.  The posted speed limit for vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) was 64 kph (40 mph). V2 was a 2005 Mercury Sable was traveling northbound and was stopped for a stop/slow sign for the construction zone.  Upon realization of the impending crash, the driver of V2 stated that he could not do anything.  V1 was a 2002 Dodge Neon, traveling northbound.  V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper.  The impact caused V1 to push V2 up the roadway.  V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway.  V1 was towed due to damage.  V2 was able to be driven from the scene.I spoke to the construction worker on scene, which was holding the stop sign.  He was only able to give a few words, due to the language barrier.  He attested that V2 was waiting for the sign to change, so V2 could proceed.  He further stated that V1 pushed V2 up the roadway some."

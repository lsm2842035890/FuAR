        "     The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  The northbound travel lane was controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH and both roads were level.     V1 was a 2002 Mazda 323 hatchback traveling northbound in the right lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 1997 Nissan Maxima sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching the intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing northeast.  V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he was stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions, then proceeded thru the intersection but saw V2 in the corner of his eye.  The driver of V1 braked and swerved right but was unable to avoid contact with V2.  V1 was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  It was mid-morning and heavy rain was present.  The gradient for both roadways of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 travel were level.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 64 kmph (40mph).V1, a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire operated by a 18-year-old male, was traveling westbound.  V2, a 2003 Hyundai Elantra operated by a 24-year-old male, was traveling eastbound.  V1 crossed the centerline, entered the eastbound lane, and impacted V2 head-on.  The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise; V1 came to final rest in the westbound lane facing south.  The driver of V2 was initially traveling straight and then attempted to avoid the collision by steering the vehicle to the right.  V2 rotated clockwise before coming to final rest between a mailbox and telephone pole.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by EMS to a local hospital.  After obtaining the interview from the driver of V1, it is likely that work and sleep patterns contributed to this crash. The driver was traveling home after working the graveyard shift.  "

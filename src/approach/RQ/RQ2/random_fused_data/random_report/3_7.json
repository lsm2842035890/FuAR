        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH (64KPH).  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash.     Vehicle #1, a 2002 Acura MDX, was parked off the right side of the roadway in an unimproved area used by a business for parking.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 GMC Vandura designated as a school bus, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway.  Vehicle #1 entered the roadway from the right into path of Vehicle #2 to execute an illegal U-turn.  Vehicle #2 braked and steered left to avoid a collision.  Vehicle #2 struck Vehicle #1 in left side with its front.  Vehicle #2 came to rest facing in a northwesterly direction.  Vehicle #1 was rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest facing in a northerly direction.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Acura MDX (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 51 year old male who was treated at the scene for a laceration to his arm.  He stated that he had stopped to pick up lunch for his co-workers and was going to make a U-turn to return to work.  He stated that he had glanced at the traffic light (behind him) and thought it was red.  He also stated that he had looked, but didn't see the bus.  He estimated that he was traveling less than 10 MPH at the time of impact and made no avoidance maneuvers.  Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage.",

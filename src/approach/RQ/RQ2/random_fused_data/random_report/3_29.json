        "This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight with a downhill grade of -2/61.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.  The speed limit for the roadway was 48kmph (30mph).  On the right of the southbound lanes was a gas station and a carwash. Vehicle # 1 was a 1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT, that was traveling southbound on the right lane.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1996 Ford Windstar that was traveling northbound on the left lane and attempting to turn left into the Gas Station.  Due to a sightline restriction from a non-contact vehicle, the front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the right-front wheel of Vehicle # 2.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was driven by a 40-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 25 mph when a mini-van traveling northbound attempted to make a left-turn.  The driver stated that he tried to brake but it was too late because his sightline was restricted by another vehicle on the left-lane.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was not towed due to damage. ",
        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-lane roadway controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 25 MPH.    V1 was a 2003 Saturn LW 300 station wagon traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 2004 Ford Explorer SUV, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  V1 drove thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the intersection.  V2 then struck a curb.  V1 and V2 came to final rest facing northeast.     V1 was driven by a 56-year-old female who sustained minor injuries but was not transported.  She stated that she was not familiar with this roadway.  As she approached the intersection she was distracted by an ambulance and did not see the stop sign.  She failed to stop for the TCD and struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 21-30 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "     This two-vehicle crash occurred mid-morning hours during daylight hours in a rural residential area in a type T intersection. The north/south bound two-lane roadway is straight, level and without traffic control devices.  The west/east bound two-lane roadway is straight and downhill for westbound travel and controlled by a stop sign where it dead-ends with the other roadway. The speed limit for the area is 40 kph (25 mph). with no adverse weather or road conditions present.     Vehicle one (V1) a 1972 Ford Galaxie 4-door sedan driven by a 35 year-old male was traveling westbound approaching the stop sign when the driver discovered the brakes were inoperative.  Vehicle #1 steered to the left slightly before it entered the intersection without stopping.  Vehicle two (V2) a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup driven by a 48 year-old male was traveling northbound when it's front right side plane was contacted by the front bumper V1. V1 came to rest facing west. V2 came to rest in the south bound lane facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.     The pre-event movement for V1 coded going straight, category this vehicle control loss due to disabling vehicle failure (brakes). Critical reason for the critical event vehicle related factor \"brakes failed\"."

        "    The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west two-lane state secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane residential road.  The residential road intersected from the north to form the three-leg intersection and had a stop sign and a flashing red traffic signal.  Traffic on the arterial road had a flashing yellow caution signal in both directions at the intersection.  West of the intersection the arterial road is straight and level.  East of the intersection the arterial curves to the south with a radius of curvature of 141m and had a slight downgrade as it approached the intersection.  The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35mph).  Construction grading was underway on the south side of the road, the arterial was being widened to four lanes and straightened.  At the time of the crash no workers were present only materials that had been at the site for several months.  There are no construction warning signs since traffic is not affected by the roadwork.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Focus traveling east on the two-lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was westbound on the same road.   Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left on the two lane residential road and its front was struck by the front left of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.      Vehicle #1 was driven by a 48-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags and not injured in the crash.  She stated that the other vehicle slowed down and she assumed it was stopping at the intersection.  She drove the road monthly but felt the intersection was somewhat confusing.  ",
        "This two vehicle crash occurred during early evening hours at a T-intersection during dusk, rush hour traffic.  There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of this crash.  The bituminous roadway was dry.  The south roadway  level, undivided, two-way traffic way controlled by a stop sign. The west roadway has a positive 8% sloped, undivided, 5-lane traffic way, with no traffic controls. Posted speed limit 56 kmph (35 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a  2004, 4-door Chrysler Sebring driven by a 44 year-old female with one passenger was stopped at the stop sign for several minutes in the curb lane waiting to turn left across the westbound and center 2-way left turn lane.  Vehicle two (V2), a  1996 4-door Dodge Intrepid driven by a 33 year-old male was approaching the T-intersection in lane 2 going straight.  V1 proceeded its left turn across westbound lanes and its front collided with the front of V2.  V1's left front corner contacted the right front corner of V2.  The force of the impact caused V1 to rotate at least 90 degrees clockwise and it came to final rest in lanes one and two of the westbound travel lanes.  After the first impact V2 traveled southwest across the center 2-way lane and two eastbound lanes.  V2 came to final rest on top of the south curb edge and sidewalk of the traffic way.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view.  A non-contact large truck in the number one eastbound travel lane obstructed the view of V2, which was in the number two adjacent eastbound lane, for the driver of V1.  Associative factor driver of V1 may have been upset due to recent divorce, maybe fatigue due to spending most of the day shopping for household furniture brought on by a recent divorce.  The driver had been frustrated waiting at the stop sign to turn left and proceeded to turn left when her passenger said traffic to the right was clear.",

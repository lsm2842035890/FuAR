        "\tThe crash occurred at a T-intersection of an eastbound 5-lane undivided roadway and a northbound driveway exit from a parking lot.  The eastbound roadway was a two-way, five-lane roadway with a two-way left turn lane in the middle.  Both the eastbound roadway and the driveway were straight, level, bituminous roadways.   The posted speed for east/west traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph).  Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies.  Traffic flow in the eastbound direction was backed up for a light at a signalized intersection up ahead.    \tV1, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was stopped at a stop sign at the parking lot exit, waiting to turn left.  V2, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in the two-way left turn lane.  Traffic in the first two eastbound lanes was backed up for a traffic light ahead.  Vehicles in those lanes made space for V1 to pull out.  As V1 pulled out to turn left, the front of V1 made contact with the front of V2 in the third (middle) lane of travel.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.   \tV1 was driven by a 23-year old female who sustained possible injuries.  She was transported to the hospital from the crash scene by her boyfriend.  She stated that she had stopped at the drug store on her way to the hospice to see her grandmother.  Eastbound traffic was backed up, but the first two lanes left a gap for her to exit.  She said that one of the drivers waved her out.  She stated that she didn't see anything, so she cautiously pulled out.  The driver indicated that she did not know where the other vehicle came from.    ",
        "This crash occurred on an urban intersection and involved two vehicles.  The crash occurred at a T-intersection. Traffic approaching the intersection traveling northbound is controlled by a stop sign located at the southeast corner of the intersection.  The weather at the time of the crash was clear.  The speed limit on the east/west through street, which has one lane in each direction and is undivided,  is posted 64 kmph (40 mph).  The speed limit on the north/south cross street, which also has one lane in each direction and is undivided, is posted 40 kmph (25 mph).  Vehicle one (V1) was a 2001 Toyota Tacoma 2wd pickup truck that was stopped facing north at the stop sign.  Vehicle two (V2) was a 1998 Honda Accord 4 door sedan. V2 was traveling E/B on the through street, which is a two-lane dry level, asphalt roadway, in the number one lane.  V1 was stopped for approximately 10 seconds on the intersecting roadway in the number one lane waiting to turn left.  A non-contact vehicle that wasforward of V2 but in the same lane as V2, made a right turn onto the street that V1 was stopped on.  There was a sight line restriction for the drivers of V1 and V2 created by the non-contact vehicle turning right.  The driver of V1 began to make a left turn onto the through street into path of V2.  The front of V1 impacted with V2's right front corner. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise coming to rest facing east in the eastbound number one eastbound travel lane facing east. V2 moved forward after impact and also came to rest in the number one eastbound travel lane facing east.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene.The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.   The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view. The driver looked but did not see V2 prior to impact. The sight line was blocked by the non-contact vehicle turning right onto the cross street. "

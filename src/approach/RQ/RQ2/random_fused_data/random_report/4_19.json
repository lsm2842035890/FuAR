        "The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  It was mid-morning and heavy rain was present.  The gradient for both roadways of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 travel were level.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 64 kmph (40mph).V1, a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire operated by a 18-year-old male, was traveling westbound.  V2, a 2003 Hyundai Elantra operated by a 24-year-old male, was traveling eastbound.  V1 crossed the centerline, entered the eastbound lane, and impacted V2 head-on.  The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise; V1 came to final rest in the westbound lane facing south.  The driver of V2 was initially traveling straight and then attempted to avoid the collision by steering the vehicle to the right.  V2 rotated clockwise before coming to final rest between a mailbox and telephone pole.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by EMS to a local hospital.  After obtaining the interview from the driver of V1, it is likely that work and sleep patterns contributed to this crash. The driver was traveling home after working the graveyard shift.  "

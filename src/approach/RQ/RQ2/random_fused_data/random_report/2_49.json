The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was dark out but the roadway was lighted and it was dry.  Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Dodge Stratus, which was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Nissan Altima that was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the left lane.  On this roadway, Vehicle #1 was attempting to make a U-turn to travel northbound when it was contacted on its left plane by Vehicle #2's frontal plane. The crash occurred on a non-junction roadway with no traffic signs or signals. Both vehicles came to final rest on the sidewalk of the northbound lanes. "

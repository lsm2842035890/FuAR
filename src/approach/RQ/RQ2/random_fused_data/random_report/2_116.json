        "This crash occurred in the intersection of a north/south road with one lane in each direction and an east/west road with one lane in each direction.  The roadways were straight and level and each had a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was raining and the roadways were wet.  The crash occurred in the morning hours on a weekend.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina that was traveling southbound. Vehicle #2 was a 2003 Lexus LS430 that was traveling westbound.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #2 impacted the left side of Vehicle #1.  The impact spun Vehicle #1 counter-clockwise and the right side impacted a train support pillar.  Vehicle #1 then spun clockwise to its final rest, facing northbound.The Chevrolet Lumina (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 52-year old male who did not sustain any injuries. A 52-year old female occupant in the front-right seat sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local medical facility.  The driver stated that he was going straight and had the green light when Vehicle #2 ran the red light, which caused him to impact the train support pillar.  The Chevrolet Lumina was towed due to damage.",

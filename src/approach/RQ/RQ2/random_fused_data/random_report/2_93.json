        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of an undivided two-way roadway, with two lanes of travel in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was dark out but the roadway was lighted and it was dry.  Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Dodge Stratus, which was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Nissan Altima that was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the left lane.  On this roadway, Vehicle #1 was attempting to make a U-turn to travel northbound when it was contacted on its left plane by Vehicle #2's frontal plane. The crash occurred on a non-junction roadway with no traffic signs or signals. Both vehicles came to final rest on the sidewalk of the northbound lanes. ",
        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway that was divided by a raised curb median with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph).  The weather was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was the evening hours of a weekday and it was dark out but the roadway was lighted. The crash occurred at a signalized intersection with an east/west roadway.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage that was traveling southbound in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1995 Ford Probe that was traveling northbound in the left lane and attempting to make a left turn.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right front side of Vehicle #2, and then Vehicle #2 impacted a chain-link fence that was located on the southwest corner of the intersection.The Mitsubishi Mirage (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 40-year old female who was transported to a local medical facility with incapacitating injuries.  A 21-year old female sustained minor injuries and a 12-year old male in her vehicle sustained non-incapacitating injuries and were both transported to a local medical facility.  Vehicle #1 was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 turned in front of it.  The Mirage was towed due to damage."

        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a one-way North-South road and a two-way East-West road.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  The conditions were daylight and the roadway was dry.  Vehicle # 1 was a Chevrolet Malibu, which was traveling northbound on a one-way roadway with one lane.  Vehicle # 2 was a Chevrolet G-Series Van that was traveling eastbound on a two-way roadway with one-lane in each direction and stopped for the stop sign.  At the intersection, Vehicle # 1 proceeded through and the front of Vehicle # 2 contacted the left side of Vehicle # 1.Vehicle # 1 was driven by a 37-year old male, who had two occupants, an 11 year-old female in the front-right position and a 10-year old female in the back-right seat.  The 11-year old female and the 10-year old female both sustained minor injuries and were transported to a medical facility.  The Chevrolet Malibu was towed.",
        "The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry and EMS was dispatched in the early evening of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and a 1% uphill grade.V1 was a 2002 Lexus RX 300 SUV that was initially traveling before coming to a complete stop at the intersection and intending on turning left.  V2 was a 1994 Ford Taurus sedan directly in back of V2 intending on going straight.  The driver of V2 was looking to the left then looked straight ahead.  V2 tried to steer left and brake to avoid V1.  The front of V2 struck the back of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing west.",
        "The crash occurred at a T-intersection on an eastbound/westbound roadway. V1 was traveling westbound on a five-lane (two westbound and two eastbound with a center turn lane) undivided roadway. V2 was traveling on a two-lane (one northbound and one southbound) undivided roadway. Both asphalt roadways were dry, level, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40 kmph (25mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a weekday. Traffic was heavy on the east/westbound roadway. V1, a 4-door 1999 Nissan Altima, was traveling westbound in lane #1 when it struck with its front end the left side of V2, a 4-door 1987 Buick Lesabre. V2 had been southbound on the intersecting roadway, and was attempting a left turn at the T-intersection. V2 had a stop sign posted at the corner of the T-intersection and had stopped before initiating its turn. According to the interview, the driver of V2 was attempting to merge into the oncoming traffic and didn't see the vehicle coming from her left. The driver of V1, a 39-year old male, stated that there was a curve several feet before the intersection and it took away his ability to see V2 crossing in front of him. The driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway - he drove on it daily. The driver of V1 was not injured. V1 was not towed."

        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway that was divided by a raised curb median with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph).  The weather was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was the evening hours of a weekday and it was dark out but the roadway was lighted. The crash occurred at a signalized intersection with an east/west roadway.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage that was traveling southbound in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1995 Ford Probe that was traveling northbound in the left lane and attempting to make a left turn.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right front side of Vehicle #2, and then Vehicle #2 impacted a chain-link fence that was located on the southwest corner of the intersection.The Mitsubishi Mirage (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 40-year old female who was transported to a local medical facility with incapacitating injuries.  A 21-year old female sustained minor injuries and a 12-year old male in her vehicle sustained non-incapacitating injuries and were both transported to a local medical facility.  Vehicle #1 was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 turned in front of it.  The Mirage was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. It was not physically divided, and had a traffic-control device for this 'T' intersection. The conditions were as follows: late evening, clear skies, the roadway was dry and there were no atmospheric conditions. The gradient for the two vehicles involved were both on a -2% roadway. The posted speed limit for vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was a 2005 Toyota Tundra, traveling southbound. V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper. The driver side airbags for V1 inflated, and the driver was wearing his seatbelt. The impact caused V1 to push V2 further down the roadway. V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was able to be driven from the scene. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as other motor vehicle in lane and was stopped. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event is internal distraction - a driver error. In the PAR the driver stated that items in the front seat area started to fall. He took his eyes off the road to look at the items and when he looked back it was too late to stop. After numerous attempts to try and attain an interview, they were unsuccessful.",
        "This two-vehicle collision occurred mid-afternoon in a three-way intersection.  Southbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign traffic device.  Road surface dry asphalt, no adverse weather condition or sight restrictions. The posted speed limit 48 kMmph (30 mph). The east/west roadway has a +8% grade.Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Yamaha 600cc motorcycle driven by a 36 year-old male, was traveling west.

The driver of V1 came to final rest at the northwest corner of the intersection and the motorcycle came to rest in the intersection at point of impact. V2 came to rest facing east in the westbound lanes. Both  V1 and V2 were towed from the scene, the driver of V1 was transported to a local medical facility.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle.  Associative factors for V 1 driver are as follows: driver performed various decision errors (aggressive driving behaviors).  V 1 driver violated a traffic signal, accelerated excessively  while weaving in and out of travel lanes, and failed to look far enough ahead for possible crossing traffic.

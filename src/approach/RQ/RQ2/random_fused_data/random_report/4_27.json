        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight with cloudy skies and rain in the morning on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Acura 3.2 TL sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection with a stop sign.  V2, a 1993 Ford Aerostar minivan, was traveling southbound in the right lane approaching the T-intersection.  V1 made a left turn at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left front corner of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 spun clockwise and came to final rest facing westbound.  V2 came to final rest facing southbound.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-way, three-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 72kph (45mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  Vehicle one (V1) was exiting a parking lot, which had a gradient of +2.  Vehicle two (V2) was going straight on a level roadway, passing the parking lot from where V1 was exiting.  There were no traffic control devices present at the location of this crash.    V1 a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee was attempting to make a left onto the westbound roadway from a parking lot from a convenience store.  V2 a 1992 Chevy Cavalier was traveling east on the main roadway at approximately 64kph (40mph).  The front left of V2 made contact with the left rear of V1.  The impact caused V1 to spin counter clockwise before coming to final rest in the westbound lane.  V2 continued further ahead before coming to rest in between lanes one and two of the roadway.   Vehicle two was removed from the scene due to moderate damage, whereas vehicle one suffered minor damage and was removed by the owner.  ",
        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available.",
        "\tThe crash occurred in the early evening hours while still daylight at a T-intersection.  The main street was an east/west two-lane two-way roadway with no traffic control. The posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). The crossing street ran north/south and ended at the T-intersection.  The north/south roadway was a two-lane two-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The east west roadway had a shoulder on either side, which diminished as it neared the intersection.  The roadway was divided by two solid yellow lines.  There were no adverse weather conditions that day and both roadways were dry.   \tV1, a 1998 Ford Taurus station wagon, was driven by a 20-year old female. V1 was traveling west on the east/west roadway. V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 24-year old female. V2 was traveling south on the north/south roadway. According to police and witness reports, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop at her stop sign, facing south.  The driver of V2 then entered the intersection and attempted to turn left to travel east on the east/west roadway.  As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1. The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.  V1 rolled off of the sidewalk and came to rest facing south in the middle of the two east/west lanes.\tThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as \"other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.\" The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to V1, although excess speed was coded as an associated factor. A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact. The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). All other information was unknown due to the lack of an interview with the driver of V1."

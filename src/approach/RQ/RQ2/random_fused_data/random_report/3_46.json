        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a three-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dark with lights, dry with cloudy skies in the evening on a weekday.  The westbound lanes had a posted speed of 80 kmph (50 mph), the southbound lane had a speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 1998 Ford Escort sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection with a stop sign.  V2, a 1993 Subaru Legacy sedan, was traveling westbound in the right lane approaching the T-intersection.  V1 made a left turn at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing westbound.  ",
        "       This two-vehicle crash occurred in the morning at 0740 hours at a traffic-signal-controlled T-intersection. The north/south roadway is straight, level, dry and has two lanes in each direction that are separated by a painted median. The intersecting roadway (that branches on the west side of the north/south road) is a two-lane, undivided, level, straight east/west roadway. The speed limit on both roadways is 48 kph (30 mph) and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.       Vehicle one,(V 1) a 1992 Cadillac Deville, was southbound in the second lane. Vehicle two,(V 2) a 1993 Ford F-150 pickup truck, was eastbound at the intersection. The light turned red for vehicle one and green for vehicle two. As vehicle two turned left at the intersection, the front of vehicle one struck the left side vehicle two. Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection and were towed due to damage. The driver of V 1 a forty-six-year-old female, disregarded the red traffic signal. No information was obtained from this driver. The driver of V 2 a twenty-year-old male, was driving from home to work. He was well rested, familiar with his vehicle and his route, not in a hurry and comfortable with his twenty-year-old male passenger. He was listening to the radio, but this did not distract him from his driving responsibilities.       The pre-event movement for V 1 coded going straight, category this vehicle traveling crossing over passing through intersection. Critical reason driver related factor \"illegal maneuver\" (disregard of traffic control signal).",
        "This two vehicle crash occurred during evening hours at a T-intersection with the east/west roadway controlled by a stop sign. The road surface dry,level concrete with overhead lighting. The posted speed limit 64 kmph (40 mph). Vehicle one (V1), a 1984 Buick Park Avenue sedan driven by a 31 year-old female with three passengers, was traveling northbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Jeep Cherokee driven by a 17 year-old male, was  traveling south in lane 2 of a 4 lane undivided concrete roadway with a negative grade.   The driver of V2 was traveling the speed limit until the driver decided to turn around and go back the other direction.  The driver of V2 saw a street to turn into, slowed down and turned left.  At this time V2 impacted the front of V 1 with it's front bumper.  V2 rotated counter clockwise and struck the left side of V1 with it's right front tire.  V2 came to final rest  facing northwest in the middle of the intersection.  V1 was traveling north in  lane 1 of a 4 lane undivided concrete roadway with a positive grade.  The driver of V1  was talking to the passengers in the vehicle at the time of the crash.  The driver saw V2 approach the intersection and assumed that the vehicle would stop and wait until traffic had cleared before turning.  After the initial impact V1 rotated counter clockwise and struck the right front tire of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing northwest in the middle of the street.   All occupants were transported to a local medical facility. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line.  The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle."

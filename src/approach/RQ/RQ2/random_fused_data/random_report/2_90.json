        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were cloudy with rain in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH.  The northbound lane had a -3% downhill grade.  The southbound lane had a positive 2 % uphill grade.     V1 was a 1995 Mercedes Benz S420 sedan traveling northbound in the first travel lane negotiating a curve left.  V2, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was traveling southbound in the first travel lane about to negotiate the curve.  V1 lost control of her vehicle and began to spin in a counterclockwise rotation.  V1 crossed over the centerline and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast.  V2 came to final rest facing easr-southeast.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was not injured.  She refused to be interviewed but a surrogate interview was obtained by the investigating police officer.  He stated that the driver of V1 was speeding while negotiating the curve, which caused the driver to lose control on the wet pavement.  V1 then spun counterclockwise and crossed over the centerline and struck V2.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 31 and 40 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon near a crossover of a multi-lane highway divided by a grass median. The southbound side had three lanes including a left-turn lane; the northbound side had four lanes that included a right and left turn lane at a T-intersection. The posted speed limit for both directions was 89 kmph (55 mph) and weather conditions were cloudy and dry.V1, a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier driven by a 17-year old male, was traveling south in lane three approaching the T-intersection. V2, a 1995 Honda Accord driven by a 32-year old female, was traveling north in lane 3 approaching the same intersection. V1 entered the crossover area and then initiated a left turn. As V1 crossed into the northbound lanes, it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. V1 came to final rest in northeast roadside of the intersection and V2 came to rest in the same lane it was originally traveling. The driver of V1 was returning home from work and was attempting to make a left turn when he turned in front of the Honda Accord. He reported that there were other vehicles obstructing his view of oncoming traffic but he decided to turn left anyway. He said he never saw the Honda that struck him so he never tried to avoid the collision. He was not injured in the crash."

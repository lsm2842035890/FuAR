        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway that was divided by a raised curb median with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph).  The weather was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was the evening hours of a weekday and it was dark out but the roadway was lighted. The crash occurred at a signalized intersection with an east/west roadway.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage that was traveling southbound in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1995 Ford Probe that was traveling northbound in the left lane and attempting to make a left turn.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right front side of Vehicle #2, and then Vehicle #2 impacted a chain-link fence that was located on the southwest corner of the intersection.The Mitsubishi Mirage (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 40-year old female who was transported to a local medical facility with incapacitating injuries.  A 21-year old female sustained minor injuries and a 12-year old male in her vehicle sustained non-incapacitating injuries and were both transported to a local medical facility.  Vehicle #1 was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 turned in front of it.  The Mirage was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and there were no traffic signals associated with this stretch of roadway.  The roadway was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident.  The roadway is considered to be level where the crash occurred.  Vehicle one (V1) was a white minivan traveling west and intending to continue straight on the roadway.  Vehicle two (V2) was a red pick-up truck, legally parked on the eastbound shoulder of the roadway.  There was an occupant in the driver's side of the vehicle, however V2 should be considered not in transport.  V1 crossed the double yellow lines and struck a wall first before continuing forward, and making contact with the parked pick-up.  The impact between vehicles caused V2 to be pushed up over the curb before coming to final rest.  V1 had considerable damage to the front and driver side of the vehicle and had to be removed from the scene.  V2 had minor damage and did not have to be removed from the scene.  The driver of V1 was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, although injuries were thought to be minor.  The follow up interview with the driver revealed that he might have been talking on the CB radio right before the crash occurred, but he wasn't entirely certain.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) when all of a sudden, he veered left and side swiped a brick wall.  He then applied the foot brakes but could not bring the vehicle to a stop before contacting the pick-up truck that was parked on the shoulder.  No fatigue or health related issues were thought to have contributed to this crash.  The driver did say that he had diabetes and was taking medication to help control that condition.  In addition, he was taking a cholesterol-lowering medication as well.  The Critical Precrash Event was coded as: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as an internal distraction.  ",
        "This two vehicle crash occurred during early evening hours at a T-intersection during dusk, rush hour traffic.  There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of this crash.  The bituminous roadway was dry.  The south roadway  level, undivided, two-way traffic way controlled by a stop sign. The west roadway has a positive 8% sloped, undivided, 5-lane traffic way, with no traffic controls. Posted speed limit 56 kmph (35 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a  2004, 4-door Chrysler Sebring driven by a 44 year-old female with one passenger was stopped at the stop sign for several minutes in the curb lane waiting to turn left across the westbound and center 2-way left turn lane.  Vehicle two (V2), a  1996 4-door Dodge Intrepid driven by a 33 year-old male was approaching the T-intersection in lane 2 going straight.  V1 proceeded its left turn across westbound lanes and its front collided with the front of V2.  V1's left front corner contacted the right front corner of V2.  The force of the impact caused V1 to rotate at least 90 degrees clockwise and it came to final rest in lanes one and two of the westbound travel lanes.  After the first impact V2 traveled southwest across the center 2-way lane and two eastbound lanes.  V2 came to final rest on top of the south curb edge and sidewalk of the traffic way.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view.  A non-contact large truck in the number one eastbound travel lane obstructed the view of V2, which was in the number two adjacent eastbound lane, for the driver of V1.  Associative factor driver of V1 may have been upset due to recent divorce, maybe fatigue due to spending most of the day shopping for household furniture brought on by a recent divorce.  The driver had been frustrated waiting at the stop sign to turn left and proceeded to turn left when her passenger said traffic to the right was clear."

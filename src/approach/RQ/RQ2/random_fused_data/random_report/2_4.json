V1 was a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan stopped westbound at the stop sign in the first travel lane.  V2, a 2003 Nissan 350Z coupe, was traveling northbound in the second travel lane intending on going straight.  V1 was waved into the intersection by an unknown vehicle stopped in the 1st travel lane facing northbound.  V1 proceeded thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the 2nd travel lane of the northbound roadway.  The driver of V1 lost consciousness and his vehicle traveled southbound hitting a curb and several signs traveling approximately 115 meters.  V1 came to final rest against a pole facing westbound.

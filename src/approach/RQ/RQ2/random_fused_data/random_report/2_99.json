        "       The crash occurred in the left lane of a level two-lane roadway with a concrete median barrier (4 lanes total).  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 MPH).     V1 was a 1996 Chevy S10 pickup truck traveling southbound in the left lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2005 Nissan Quest minivan, was traveling southbound directly in front of V1.  V2 was stopped when the front of V1 struck the rear of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     A 17-year old male drove V1 and was not injured.  Both driver and parent of the driver refused to be interviewed.  V1 was driven away from the scene.",
        "\tThis crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the eastbound lanes of an urban roadway near a T-intersection.  The east/west roadway consisted of two through lanes flanked by a designated right turn lane and a designated left turn lane in the eastbound direction and two through lanes in the westbound direction.  The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph).  Traffic was congested, but flowing and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.\tV1, a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette two-door with one occupant was eastbound in lane three.  V2, a 1990 Buick Regal two-door with one occupant was stopped eastbound in lane three ahead of V1 waiting for the light at the intersection ahead of him to turn green and traffic to proceed.  As light turned green and V2 began to accelerate V1 struck V2's rear.  A witness stated that the driver of V1 was traveling between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph) when he made the avoidance action of steering right but could not avoid V2.  Both vehicles rolled forward and came to final rest near the point of impact.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  \tThe driver of V1, an unknown aged male, fled the scene shortly after maneuvering the vehicle off the road.  No further information could be obtained regarding the driver as the owner of the vehicle told the police it had been taken without him knowing."

        "This crash occurred in the right lane of the northbound lanes of an undivided roadway with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was cloudy and raining.  The roadway was wet and had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred at a 4-way signalized intersection.  Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Toyota Camry that stopped for an emergency vehicle traveling westbound with the emergency lights on.  Vehicle #2 was a 2000 Nissan Sentra that was behind Vehicle #1 and could not stop in time.  Vehicle #2 rear-ended Vehicle #1.   The emergency vehicle was crossing over the intersection.A seventy-four year old male who did not sustain any injuries drove the Toyota Camry.  He stated that he saw the emergency vehicle trying to go through the intersection so he slowed down and came to a stop.  As he stopped, he was rear-ended by Vehicle #2. ",
        "The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  It was mid-morning and heavy rain was present.  The gradient for both roadways of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 travel were level.  The posted speed limit on the roadway was 64 kmph (40mph).V1, a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire operated by a 18-year-old male, was traveling westbound.  V2, a 2003 Hyundai Elantra operated by a 24-year-old male, was traveling eastbound.  V1 crossed the centerline, entered the eastbound lane, and impacted V2 head-on.  The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise; V1 came to final rest in the westbound lane facing south.  The driver of V2 was initially traveling straight and then attempted to avoid the collision by steering the vehicle to the right.  V2 rotated clockwise before coming to final rest between a mailbox and telephone pole.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by EMS to a local hospital.  After obtaining the interview from the driver of V1, it is likely that work and sleep patterns contributed to this crash. The driver was traveling home after working the graveyard shift.  ",

The driver of V1 came to final rest at the northwest corner of the intersection and the motorcycle came to rest in the intersection at point of impact. V2 came to rest facing east in the westbound lanes. Both  V1 and V2 were towed from the scene, the driver of V1 was transported to a local medical facility.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.

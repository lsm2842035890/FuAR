        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway that was divided by a raised curb median with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph).  The weather was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was the evening hours of a weekday and it was dark out but the roadway was lighted. The crash occurred at a signalized intersection with an east/west roadway.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage that was traveling southbound in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1995 Ford Probe that was traveling northbound in the left lane and attempting to make a left turn.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right front side of Vehicle #2, and then Vehicle #2 impacted a chain-link fence that was located on the southwest corner of the intersection.The Mitsubishi Mirage (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 40-year old female who was transported to a local medical facility with incapacitating injuries.  A 21-year old female sustained minor injuries and a 12-year old male in her vehicle sustained non-incapacitating injuries and were both transported to a local medical facility.  Vehicle #1 was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 turned in front of it.  The Mirage was towed due to damage.",
        "    The crash occurred at the T-intersection of an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane local road.  The arterial curves to the south (left) as it approaches the intersection from the east with a radius of curvature of 375m.  Traffic counts indicate it carries 9,036 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).  The local road is straight and is controlled by a stop sign with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph).  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.    Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with four horses westbound on the two lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound on the local road.  Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn to go east when its left side was struck by the front of Vehicle #1.   After impact the F-250 (V1) rotated counterclockwise and jackknifed with the truck coming to rest partially off the south side of the intersection facing southeast.  The trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest.  The Corolla (V2) rotated clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not injured in the crash.    She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection.  However, she didn't believe the Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance.  Once she realized Vehicle #2 was beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision.  "

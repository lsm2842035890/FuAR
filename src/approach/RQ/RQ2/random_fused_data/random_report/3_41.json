        "     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH). The roadway for Vehicle #2 was slightly curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 1,125 meters. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty, was traveling north in the second straight/left turn lane approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 Mazda 626, was traveling south in the right hand lane approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles had a green light. Vehicle #1 stopped waiting for traffic to clear prior to making the left hand turn.  Vehicle #1 proceeded to make the left turn and struck Vehicle #2 in its front with front.  Vehicle #1 drove off the road into a driveway.  Vehicle #2 continued a short distance and came to rest facing in a southerly direction in its original lane.  Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Dodge Dynasty (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 71 year old female who had a bruise to her right forearm from the deployed airbag, but refused treatment.  She stated that she was on an errand for her grandson at her anticipated destination.  She stated that she had stopped waiting for traffic to clear before making the left, thought she had a green light at the time as she made the turn.  As she proceeded to make the turn, she indicated that she saw the other vehicle \"out of the corner of her eye\" at the last second, but the other vehicle was \"right there\" and she was unable to avoid the crash. She also stated that she had just accelerated from a stop and was traveling no more than 5-10 MPH.  She indicated that the other vehicle was traveling pretty fast and that she never saw her until she was right there.",
        "     The crash occurred in the middle of an intersection of a four-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph) for V1 and 72 kmph (45 mph) for V2.     V1 was a 2003 Buick Century sedan traveling northbound in the 3rd travel lane approaching a green traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2004 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling southbound in the second travel lane approaching the same green traffic control signal intending on continuing straight.  V1 looked but did not see V2 approaching and proceeded to make a left turn at the intersection.  The front right of V1 struck the front of V2 in the middle of the intersection.  V1 then spun 45 degrees and both vehicles came to final rest facing southwest.     A 74-year old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but refused any medical attention.  He stated that he was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH when he approached the intersection, looked ahead, then turned left.  The driver of V1 did not see V2 at all.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and there were no traffic signals associated with this stretch of roadway.  The roadway was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident.  The roadway is considered to be level where the crash occurred.  Vehicle one (V1) was a white minivan traveling west and intending to continue straight on the roadway.  Vehicle two (V2) was a red pick-up truck, legally parked on the eastbound shoulder of the roadway.  There was an occupant in the driver's side of the vehicle, however V2 should be considered not in transport.  V1 crossed the double yellow lines and struck a wall first before continuing forward, and making contact with the parked pick-up.  The impact between vehicles caused V2 to be pushed up over the curb before coming to final rest.  V1 had considerable damage to the front and driver side of the vehicle and had to be removed from the scene.  V2 had minor damage and did not have to be removed from the scene.  The driver of V1 was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, although injuries were thought to be minor.  The follow up interview with the driver revealed that he might have been talking on the CB radio right before the crash occurred, but he wasn't entirely certain.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) when all of a sudden, he veered left and side swiped a brick wall.  He then applied the foot brakes but could not bring the vehicle to a stop before contacting the pick-up truck that was parked on the shoulder.  No fatigue or health related issues were thought to have contributed to this crash.  The driver did say that he had diabetes and was taking medication to help control that condition.  In addition, he was taking a cholesterol-lowering medication as well.  The Critical Precrash Event was coded as: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as an internal distraction.  "

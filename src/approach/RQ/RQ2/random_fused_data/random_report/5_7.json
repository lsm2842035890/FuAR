Vehicle two, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was southbound in the right through lane. As vehicle one turned right, the front left was struck by the front of vehicle two. Vehicle one rotated clockwise and vehicle two rotated counterclockwise and the left side of vehicle one struck the right side of vehicle two. Vehicle one came to rest south of the intersection facing northeast. Vehicle two continued to rotate and rolled over four quarter-turns to the right before coming to rest facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The driver of vehicle one, an eighty-two-year-old female, was driving from a financial institution to her home. The vehicle was new to her, but she claimed to be comfortable driving it. She was also quite familiar with the route that she was traveling. She doesn't remember the stop sign, nor does she remember looking left to check for traffic before she made the right turn. "

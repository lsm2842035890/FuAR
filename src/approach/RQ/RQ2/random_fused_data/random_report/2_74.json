        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight with cloudy skies and rain in the morning on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Acura 3.2 TL sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection with a stop sign.  V2, a 1993 Ford Aerostar minivan, was traveling southbound in the right lane approaching the T-intersection.  V1 made a left turn at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left front corner of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 spun clockwise and came to final rest facing westbound.  V2 came to final rest facing southbound.",
        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash."

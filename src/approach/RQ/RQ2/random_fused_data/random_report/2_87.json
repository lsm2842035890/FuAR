        "The crash occurred on the eastbound lane of a two-way road with one lane in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions. There were no traffic control devices and the speed limit was 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 1 was a 2004 Mercury Sable that was traveling westbound.  The driver veered into the eastbound lanes and the front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the left side of a legally parked and unoccupied Ford E-Series Van. Vehicle # 1 came to a final rest when it impacted a fence on the sidewalk. The Mercury Sable (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 55 year-old female who sustained minor injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  The occupant in the front-center seating position did not sustain any injuries but was also transported to a local hospital.  The driver stated that she attempted to stop when she stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.  The Mercury Sable was towed due to damage and the driver declined to participate in the study.  ",
        "     The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were cloudy with rain in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH.  The northbound lane had a -3% downhill grade.  The southbound lane had a positive 2 % uphill grade.     V1 was a 1995 Mercedes Benz S420 sedan traveling northbound in the first travel lane negotiating a curve left.  V2, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was traveling southbound in the first travel lane about to negotiate the curve.  V1 lost control of her vehicle and began to spin in a counterclockwise rotation.  V1 crossed over the centerline and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the southbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast.  V2 came to final rest facing easr-southeast.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was not injured.  She refused to be interviewed but a surrogate interview was obtained by the investigating police officer.  He stated that the driver of V1 was speeding while negotiating the curve, which caused the driver to lose control on the wet pavement.  V1 then spun counterclockwise and crossed over the centerline and struck V2.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  The driver of V1 was traveling between 31 and 40 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

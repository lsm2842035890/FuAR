        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were dark with minimal lighting in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).  The northbound lane had a  >2% uphill grade.  The southbound lane was level.     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Corolla sedan traveling northbound in the third travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2006 Chevy Colorado pickup, was traveling southbound in the 2nd travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     V1 was driven by a 51-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  He stated that he did not see V2.  The driver did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours a traffic light controlled, three-legged intersection. The east/west roadway is divided, straight, level and the westbound lanes consist of one right turn lane, two through lanes and a left turn lane into a private driveway. The north/south roadway is divided and is a controlled-access highway ramp; in the southbound direction, the lanes are straight and downhill. The speed limit for both roadways is 56 kmph (35 mph) and it was raining at the time of the crash.Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Mazda Protege was southbound on the exit ramp from an interstate in lane two, the left turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Mercury Sable, was westbound in lane two, the right through lane. The driver of V1 thought she had the green light and started to make a left turn. V2, who actually had the green light, proceeded into the intersection and the front struck the left side of V1. V1 was pushed slightly clockwise and came to rest facing southwest in the middle of the intersection. V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest next to V1 facing southwest in the middle of the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage.The driver of V1, a forty-two-year-old female, was driving from her home to an RV park to visit a friend. She was familiar with the route and the vehicle. She took ibuprofen and an unknown brand of medication for a sinus headache several hours prior to the crash. She claimed that she had a green light, that \"the light usually stays red for 10 years.\"  "

        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-lane roadway controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 25 MPH.    V1 was a 2003 Saturn LW 300 station wagon traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 2004 Ford Explorer SUV, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  V1 drove thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the intersection.  V2 then struck a curb.  V1 and V2 came to final rest facing northeast.     V1 was driven by a 56-year-old female who sustained minor injuries but was not transported.  She stated that she was not familiar with this roadway.  As she approached the intersection she was distracted by an ambulance and did not see the stop sign.  She failed to stop for the TCD and struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 21-30 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred at a T-intersection on an eastbound/westbound roadway. V1 was traveling westbound on a five-lane (two westbound and two eastbound with a center turn lane) undivided roadway. V2 was traveling on a two-lane (one northbound and one southbound) undivided roadway. Both asphalt roadways were dry, level, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40 kmph (25mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a weekday. Traffic was heavy on the east/westbound roadway. V1, a 4-door 1999 Nissan Altima, was traveling westbound in lane #1 when it struck with its front end the left side of V2, a 4-door 1987 Buick Lesabre. V2 had been southbound on the intersecting roadway, and was attempting a left turn at the T-intersection. V2 had a stop sign posted at the corner of the T-intersection and had stopped before initiating its turn. According to the interview, the driver of V2 was attempting to merge into the oncoming traffic and didn't see the vehicle coming from her left. The driver of V1, a 39-year old male, stated that there was a curve several feet before the intersection and it took away his ability to see V2 crossing in front of him. The driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway - he drove on it daily. The driver of V1 was not injured. V1 was not towed.",
        "\tThis crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the eastbound lanes of an urban roadway near a T-intersection.  The east/west roadway consisted of two through lanes flanked by a designated right turn lane and a designated left turn lane in the eastbound direction and two through lanes in the westbound direction.  The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph).  Traffic was congested, but flowing and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.\tV1, a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette two-door with one occupant was eastbound in lane three.  V2, a 1990 Buick Regal two-door with one occupant was stopped eastbound in lane three ahead of V1 waiting for the light at the intersection ahead of him to turn green and traffic to proceed.  As light turned green and V2 began to accelerate V1 struck V2's rear.  A witness stated that the driver of V1 was traveling between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph) when he made the avoidance action of steering right but could not avoid V2.  Both vehicles rolled forward and came to final rest near the point of impact.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  \tThe driver of V1, an unknown aged male, fled the scene shortly after maneuvering the vehicle off the road.  No further information could be obtained regarding the driver as the owner of the vehicle told the police it had been taken without him knowing."

        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way roadway that is divided by a center median with three lanes in each direction.  It was daylight and clear and the ground was wet from a previous rainstorm.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph). V1 was a 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML320 that was stopped for the Traffic control device when it was rear-ended by V2, a 1996 Toyota Corolla.  Both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway.V1 was driven by a 42 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries and was unable to be located for an interview.  V1 was driven away before it could be inspected.",
        "The crash occurred at a T-intersection on an eastbound/westbound roadway. V1 was traveling westbound on a five-lane (two westbound and two eastbound with a center turn lane) undivided roadway. V2 was traveling on a two-lane (one northbound and one southbound) undivided roadway. Both asphalt roadways were dry, level, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40 kmph (25mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a weekday. Traffic was heavy on the east/westbound roadway. V1, a 4-door 1999 Nissan Altima, was traveling westbound in lane #1 when it struck with its front end the left side of V2, a 4-door 1987 Buick Lesabre. V2 had been southbound on the intersecting roadway, and was attempting a left turn at the T-intersection. V2 had a stop sign posted at the corner of the T-intersection and had stopped before initiating its turn. According to the interview, the driver of V2 was attempting to merge into the oncoming traffic and didn't see the vehicle coming from her left. The driver of V1, a 39-year old male, stated that there was a curve several feet before the intersection and it took away his ability to see V2 crossing in front of him. The driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway - he drove on it daily. The driver of V1 was not injured. V1 was not towed.",

        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a driveway related intersection.  Conditions were daylight in the morning on a weekend.  The posted speed limit for the northbound lane was 35 MPH.  There was no posted speed limit for the driveway.     V1 was a 2001 Buick Century sedan turning left out of the driveway facing westbound.  V2, a 2005 Toyota Tundra pick-up, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the driveway intending on going straight.  V1 made a left turn and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northbound.     V1 was driven by a 76-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  She stated that prior to exiting the driveway, she looked both ways and couldn't see to her left because of a big sign.  She proceeded to turn left and struck V2.  V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling less than 10 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a 6-lane asphalt constructed roadway. At the area of this crash there is a three-legged intersection with a business driveway on the south side. This roadway runs east to west with three lanes on the westbound and two lanes for the eastbound traffic. There is a center left turn only lane and the posted speed limit is 64 kmph (45 mph). The north side entrance road has two lanes and is stop sign controlled. The south side business entrance is not regulated and has a driveway type entrance. This crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or sight line obstructions.Vehicle one (V1) was a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup driven by a 85 year-old male.  V1 was eastbound and entered into the center left turn lane intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1985 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan driven by a 18 year-old male.  V2 was traveling westbound in the #3 lane approaching the intersection. As V1 entered the left turn lane it slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear. As a group of vehicles passed, V1 turned left. As V1 crossed into the westbound #3 lane it was impacted on the right side with the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to a rest on the northwest corner of this intersection.  V2 had locked up its brakes prior to the impact but could not avoid V1. V2 was disabled and towed from the scene.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

        "       The crash occurred in the left lane of a level two-lane roadway with a concrete median barrier (4 lanes total).  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 MPH).     V1 was a 1996 Chevy S10 pickup truck traveling southbound in the left lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2005 Nissan Quest minivan, was traveling southbound directly in front of V1.  V2 was stopped when the front of V1 struck the rear of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     A 17-year old male drove V1 and was not injured.  Both driver and parent of the driver refused to be interviewed.  V1 was driven away from the scene.",
        "    The crash occurred on at a T-intersection of a four lane arterial road and a two-lane residential side street.  The urban four-lane roadway ran east/west and was undivided with two way left turn lane.   The two lane residential side street went north/south and was controlled by a stop sign.  Both roads were straight and level.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Chevy Blazer northbound attempting to turn left from the residential side street to go west on the four-lane road.  Vehicle #2, a 2001 Nissan Sentra, was eastbound in the left lane of the four-lane road.  The GMC (V1) began to turn left into the center two way left turn lane and stopped in the eastbound lanes.  The front of the Nissan (V2) struck the left side of Vehicle #1.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 20-year-old male that was belted and not injured in the crash.  The front right passenger, a 21-year-old female, was belted and transported to an area hospital with minor injuries.  No airbags deployed.  It appears the driver misjudged the gap distance and panicked when he realized he couldn't make it across to the center turn lane, stopping in the eastbound lanes."

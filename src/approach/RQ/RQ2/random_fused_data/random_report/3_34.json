        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a T-intersection with a grass median.  There was one northbound left-turn only lane with a traffic control and two eastbound lanes with the same traffic control signal.  Conditions were overcast with rain with light fog in the early afternoon of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 45 MPH.     Vehicle 1 was a 1988 Mercedes Benz 300SL stopped for the traffic control intending on turning left.  Vehicle 2 was a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer driving eastbound in the right lane approaching the traffic control.  The light for the Mercedes turned green and the vehicle started turning left when the front of the Mercury struck the left-front corner of the Mercedes.  The Mercedes rotated CCW 90 degrees and the vehicle's final rest was facing east in the eastbound lane.  Final rest for the Mercury was facing east in the eastbound lane as well. ",
        "    The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west two-lane state secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane residential road.  The residential road intersected from the north to form the three-leg intersection and had a stop sign and a flashing red traffic signal.  Traffic on the arterial road had a flashing yellow caution signal in both directions at the intersection.  West of the intersection the arterial road is straight and level.  East of the intersection the arterial curves to the south with a radius of curvature of 141m and had a slight downgrade as it approached the intersection.  The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35mph).  Construction grading was underway on the south side of the road, the arterial was being widened to four lanes and straightened.  At the time of the crash no workers were present only materials that had been at the site for several months.  There are no construction warning signs since traffic is not affected by the roadwork.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Focus traveling east on the two-lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was westbound on the same road.   Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left on the two lane residential road and its front was struck by the front left of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.      Vehicle #1 was driven by a 48-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags and not injured in the crash.  She stated that the other vehicle slowed down and she assumed it was stopping at the intersection.  She drove the road monthly but felt the intersection was somewhat confusing.  ",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred at just before midnight at the \"T\" intersection of a two-lane, two-way dry, level, bituminous north/south roadway and a two-lane, two-way, dry, uphill, bituminous roadway that intersects the north/south roadway from the west.  The roadway curves to the right slightly for westbound traffic.  The intersection was controlled by a stop sign for westbound traffic.  The roadway intersects the northbound roadway at a 50-degree angle.  It was dark but lit at the time of the crash and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.  The posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 89 kmph (55 mph) and the westbound roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Chrysler Cirrus was traveling westbound approaching the intersection.  Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford Explorer was traveling northbound and pulling a trailer loaded with musical equipment.  V1 entered the intersection attempting to turn left while V2 passed through the intersection going straight.  The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1.  V1 deflected to the right and came to rest off of the roadway facing southwest.  V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest on the roadway facing south.  While V2 was rotating towards final rest, its trailer contacted the left rear of V2. The driver of V1 was a 19-year old female who maintains a regular sleep schedule of 7 hours of sleep per evening and a normal work schedule of 35 hours per week.  She was fatigued at the time of the crash.  She was familiar with the vehicle and has over 4 years of driving experience.  This was however, her first time on this particular roadway.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.   The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

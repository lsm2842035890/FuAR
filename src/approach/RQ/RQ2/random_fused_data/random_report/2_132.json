        "This crash occurred in the left lane of a one-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was dark but lighted and the roadway had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 2 was a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara that was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and slowed down for an emergency fire truck with the emergency lights and sirens attempting to go eastbound on a two-way roadway.  Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.  The Lincoln Navigator (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 27-year old male who sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  The Lincoln was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-way, three-lane, not physically divided roadway.  The posted speed limit was 72kph (45mph).  There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  Vehicle one (V1) was exiting a parking lot, which had a gradient of +2.  Vehicle two (V2) was going straight on a level roadway, passing the parking lot from where V1 was exiting.  There were no traffic control devices present at the location of this crash.    V1 a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee was attempting to make a left onto the westbound roadway from a parking lot from a convenience store.  V2 a 1992 Chevy Cavalier was traveling east on the main roadway at approximately 64kph (40mph).  The front left of V2 made contact with the left rear of V1.  The impact caused V1 to spin counter clockwise before coming to final rest in the westbound lane.  V2 continued further ahead before coming to rest in between lanes one and two of the roadway.   Vehicle two was removed from the scene due to moderate damage, whereas vehicle one suffered minor damage and was removed by the owner.  "

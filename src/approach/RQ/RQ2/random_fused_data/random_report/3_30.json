        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction and a one-way roadway with one lane of travel.  The roadway was straight and level, and had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device; the southbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. It was dark but lighted, and clear with no adverse conditions.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Lexus SC430 traveling eastbound on the two-way roadway and Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Lexus LS400 traveling south on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right side of Vehicle #2.  The front of Vehicle #1 then impacted a light-pole on the southeast corner of the intersection.  The Lexus SC430 (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 45-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 ran the stop sign and caused him to impact Vehicle #2 and then into the light-pole.  He stated that he did not perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The Lexus SC430 was towed due to damage.  ",
        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening, the weather that evening was clear with no adverse conditions, the roadway was dry.  It took place on a major highway.  The highway travels east/west.  It consists of six total travel lanes, three in each direction, divided by a physical median with a positive barrier.  The two vehicles contacted in the westbound lanes while coming off the on-ramp, the on-ramp was not a factor (they were both on the roadway at the bottom).  The on-ramp had a yield sign at the bottom where the roadway levels out.\tV2 was stopped at the bottom of the on-ramp waiting for traffic at the yield sign.  V1 was also trying to merge into traffic, but did not notice V2 stopped at the bottom of the ramp due to being distracted by traffic on the roadway, driver of V1 was trying to merge into.  After V1 contacted the rear of V2 with its' front they both came to rest in the merging traffic lane.\tThe operator of V1 states that he thought the operator of V2 had already merged into traffic. Driver of V1 was paying attention to the other traffic and never saw that V2 had not merged into traffic as he had thought.  V1 rear- ended V2 at the bottom of the ramp.  ",
        "This two-vehicle collision occurred mid-afternoon in a three-way intersection.  Southbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign traffic device.  Road surface dry asphalt, no adverse weather condition or sight restrictions. The posted speed limit 48 kMmph (30 mph). The east/west roadway has a +8% grade.Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Yamaha 600cc motorcycle driven by a 36 year-old male, was traveling west. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Ford Crown Victoria sedan driven by a 39 year-old male with three passengers, was traveling south in the process of making a left turn after stopping at a stop sign, As V2 entered the intersection V1, according to witnesses was driving at a high rate of speed, changed lanes to the left and collided with the left side of V2. The driver of V1 came to final rest at the northwest corner of the intersection and the motorcycle came to rest in the intersection at point of impact. V2 came to rest facing east in the westbound lanes. Both  V1 and V2 were towed from the scene, the driver of V1 was transported to a local medical facility.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle.  Associative factors for V 1 driver are as follows: driver performed various decision errors (aggressive driving behaviors).  V 1 driver violated a traffic signal, accelerated excessively  while weaving in and out of travel lanes, and failed to look far enough ahead for possible crossing traffic.  Medical reports indicated V1 driver  had an abnormal level of amphetamine."

        "     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH).  It was raining, the roadway was wet and it was daylight at the time of this weekday morning crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1998 Ford Contour, was traveling west exiting a parking lot driveway controlled by a flashing red light.  Vehicle #2, a 2000 Dodge Durango, was traveling north in the second lane of the main road approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #1 entered the intersection to turn left and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle #2.  Vehicle #1 was rotated counterclockwise, across the southbound lanes and came to rest off the road facing in a southeasterly direction.  Vehicle #2 drove off the road to the right and stopped in a parking lot.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Ford Contour (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 69 year old female who was transported, treated for fractured ribs and released from a local hospital.  She stated that she had just left the feed store and was waiting to pull out to make a left hand turn.  She indicated that she had been stopped for more than 10 seconds prior to proceeding and waited until other traffic had a red light as she always did.  She stated that other vehicles had stopped, but the vehicle that hit her didn't. She stated she wore glasses for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighted) conditions. She had a hearing deficiency and was wearing a hearing aid at the time of the crash.  She considered herself in fair health.",
        "    The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west two-lane state secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane residential road.  The residential road intersected from the north to form the three-leg intersection and had a stop sign and a flashing red traffic signal.  Traffic on the arterial road had a flashing yellow caution signal in both directions at the intersection.  West of the intersection the arterial road is straight and level.  East of the intersection the arterial curves to the south with a radius of curvature of 141m and had a slight downgrade as it approached the intersection.  The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35mph).  Construction grading was underway on the south side of the road, the arterial was being widened to four lanes and straightened.  At the time of the crash no workers were present only materials that had been at the site for several months.  There are no construction warning signs since traffic is not affected by the roadwork.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Focus traveling east on the two-lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was westbound on the same road.   Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left on the two lane residential road and its front was struck by the front left of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.      Vehicle #1 was driven by a 48-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags and not injured in the crash.  She stated that the other vehicle slowed down and she assumed it was stopping at the intersection.  She drove the road monthly but felt the intersection was somewhat confusing.  ",
        "This crash occurred on an urban intersection and involved two vehicles.  The crash occurred at a T-intersection. Traffic approaching the intersection traveling northbound is controlled by a stop sign located at the southeast corner of the intersection.  The weather at the time of the crash was clear.  The speed limit on the east/west through street, which has one lane in each direction and is undivided,  is posted 64 kmph (40 mph).  The speed limit on the north/south cross street, which also has one lane in each direction and is undivided, is posted 40 kmph (25 mph).  Vehicle one (V1) was a 2001 Toyota Tacoma 2wd pickup truck that was stopped facing north at the stop sign.  Vehicle two (V2) was a 1998 Honda Accord 4 door sedan. V2 was traveling E/B on the through street, which is a two-lane dry level, asphalt roadway, in the number one lane.  V1 was stopped for approximately 10 seconds on the intersecting roadway in the number one lane waiting to turn left.  A non-contact vehicle that wasforward of V2 but in the same lane as V2, made a right turn onto the street that V1 was stopped on.  There was a sight line restriction for the drivers of V1 and V2 created by the non-contact vehicle turning right.  The driver of V1 began to make a left turn onto the through street into path of V2.  The front of V1 impacted with V2's right front corner. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise coming to rest facing east in the eastbound number one eastbound travel lane facing east. V2 moved forward after impact and also came to rest in the number one eastbound travel lane facing east.  Both vehicles were towed from the scene.The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.   The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view. The driver looked but did not see V2 prior to impact. The sight line was blocked by the non-contact vehicle turning right onto the cross street. "

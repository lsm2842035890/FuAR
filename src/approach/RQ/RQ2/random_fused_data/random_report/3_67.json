        "This crash occurred in the left lane of a one-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was dark but lighted and the roadway had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 2 was a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara that was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and slowed down for an emergency fire truck with the emergency lights and sirens attempting to go eastbound on a two-way roadway.  Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.  The Lincoln Navigator (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 27-year old male who sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  The Lincoln was towed due to damage.",
        "       The crash occurred in the left lane of a level two-lane roadway with a concrete median barrier (4 lanes total).  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 MPH).     V1 was a 1996 Chevy S10 pickup truck traveling southbound in the left lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2005 Nissan Quest minivan, was traveling southbound directly in front of V1.  V2 was stopped when the front of V1 struck the rear of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     A 17-year old male drove V1 and was not injured.  Both driver and parent of the driver refused to be interviewed.  V1 was driven away from the scene.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a 6-lane asphalt constructed roadway. At the area of this crash there is a three-legged intersection with a business driveway on the south side. This roadway runs east to west with three lanes on the westbound and two lanes for the eastbound traffic. There is a center left turn only lane and the posted speed limit is 64 kmph (45 mph). The north side entrance road has two lanes and is stop sign controlled. The south side business entrance is not regulated and has a driveway type entrance. This crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or sight line obstructions.Vehicle one (V1) was a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup driven by a 85 year-old male.  V1 was eastbound and entered into the center left turn lane intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1985 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan driven by a 18 year-old male.  V2 was traveling westbound in the #3 lane approaching the intersection. As V1 entered the left turn lane it slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear. As a group of vehicles passed, V1 turned left. As V1 crossed into the westbound #3 lane it was impacted on the right side with the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to a rest on the northwest corner of this intersection.  V2 had locked up its brakes prior to the impact but could not avoid V1. V2 was disabled and towed from the scene.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

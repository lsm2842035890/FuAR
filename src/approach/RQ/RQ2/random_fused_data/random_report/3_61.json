The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.V1, a 1997 Infiniti QX4, was traveling westbound in the right lane (lane one).  V2, a 1990 Ford Crown Victoria, was traveling westbound on the middle lane (lane two).  V2 attempted to make a right turn at the intersection the right side of his vehicle collided with the left front of V1.  V1 then went off the roadway to the right and then the front impacted a breakaway light pole.V1 was driven by a 34 year-old female who sustained minor injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  She was unable to be located for an interview, but she told the police on scene that she was going straight when V2 attempted to make a right turn at the intersection.  The Infiniti was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the middle of an intersection of a four-lane roadway controlled by a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph) for V1 and 72 kmph (45 mph) for V2.     V1 was a 2003 Buick Century sedan traveling northbound in the 3rd travel lane approaching a green traffic control signal intending on turning left at the intersection.  V2, a 2004 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling southbound in the second travel lane approaching the same green traffic control signal intending on continuing straight.  V1 looked but did not see V2 approaching and proceeded to make a left turn at the intersection.  The front right of V1 struck the front of V2 in the middle of the intersection.  V1 then spun 45 degrees and both vehicles came to final rest facing southwest.     A 74-year old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but refused any medical attention.  He stated that he was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH when he approached the intersection, looked ahead, then turned left.  The driver of V1 did not see V2 at all.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon near a crossover of a multi-lane highway divided by a grass median. The southbound side had three lanes including a left-turn lane; the northbound side had four lanes that included a right and left turn lane at a T-intersection. The posted speed limit for both directions was 89 kmph (55 mph) and weather conditions were cloudy and dry.V1, a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier driven by a 17-year old male, was traveling south in lane three approaching the T-intersection. V2, a 1995 Honda Accord driven by a 32-year old female, was traveling north in lane 3 approaching the same intersection. V1 entered the crossover area and then initiated a left turn. As V1 crossed into the northbound lanes, it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. V1 came to final rest in northeast roadside of the intersection and V2 came to rest in the same lane it was originally traveling. The driver of V1 was returning home from work and was attempting to make a left turn when he turned in front of the Honda Accord. He reported that there were other vehicles obstructing his view of oncoming traffic but he decided to turn left anyway. He said he never saw the Honda that struck him so he never tried to avoid the collision. He was not injured in the crash."

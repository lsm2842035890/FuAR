        "     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH). The roadway for Vehicle #2 was slightly curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 1,125 meters. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty, was traveling north in the second straight/left turn lane approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 Mazda 626, was traveling south in the right hand lane approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles had a green light. Vehicle #1 stopped waiting for traffic to clear prior to making the left hand turn.  Vehicle #1 proceeded to make the left turn and struck Vehicle #2 in its front with front.  Vehicle #1 drove off the road into a driveway.  Vehicle #2 continued a short distance and came to rest facing in a southerly direction in its original lane.  Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Dodge Dynasty (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 71 year old female who had a bruise to her right forearm from the deployed airbag, but refused treatment.  She stated that she was on an errand for her grandson at her anticipated destination.  She stated that she had stopped waiting for traffic to clear before making the left, thought she had a green light at the time as she made the turn.  As she proceeded to make the turn, she indicated that she saw the other vehicle \"out of the corner of her eye\" at the last second, but the other vehicle was \"right there\" and she was unable to avoid the crash. She also stated that she had just accelerated from a stop and was traveling no more than 5-10 MPH.  She indicated that the other vehicle was traveling pretty fast and that she never saw her until she was right there.",

        "This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  The roadway was straight with a downhill grade of -2/61.  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.  The speed limit for the roadway was 48kmph (30mph).  On the right of the southbound lanes was a gas station and a carwash. Vehicle # 1 was a 1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT, that was traveling southbound on the right lane.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1996 Ford Windstar that was traveling northbound on the left lane and attempting to turn left into the Gas Station.  Due to a sightline restriction from a non-contact vehicle, the front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the right-front wheel of Vehicle # 2.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was driven by a 40-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was traveling approximately 25 mph when a mini-van traveling northbound attempted to make a left-turn.  The driver stated that he tried to brake but it was too late because his sightline was restricted by another vehicle on the left-lane.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT was not towed due to damage. "

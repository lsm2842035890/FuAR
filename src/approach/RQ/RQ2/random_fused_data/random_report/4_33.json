        "     The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH). The roadway for Vehicle #2 was slightly curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 1,125 meters. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash.     Vehicle #1, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty, was traveling north in the second straight/left turn lane approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #2, a 1992 Mazda 626, was traveling south in the right hand lane approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles had a green light. Vehicle #1 stopped waiting for traffic to clear prior to making the left hand turn.  Vehicle #1 proceeded to make the left turn and struck Vehicle #2 in its front with front.  Vehicle #1 drove off the road into a driveway.  Vehicle #2 continued a short distance and came to rest facing in a southerly direction in its original lane.  Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Dodge Dynasty (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 71 year old female who had a bruise to her right forearm from the deployed airbag, but refused treatment.  She stated that she was on an errand for her grandson at her anticipated destination.  She stated that she had stopped waiting for traffic to clear before making the left, thought she had a green light at the time as she made the turn.  As she proceeded to make the turn, she indicated that she saw the other vehicle \"out of the corner of her eye\" at the last second, but the other vehicle was \"right there\" and she was unable to avoid the crash. She also stated that she had just accelerated from a stop and was traveling no more than 5-10 MPH.  She indicated that the other vehicle was traveling pretty fast and that she never saw her until she was right there.",
        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane, T-intersection roadway.  Conditions were daylight and dry at 8:58 am on a Monday afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and was level.  There was a road department truck in the center of the double-yellow line approximately 100-150 feet north from point of impact.     V1 was a 1994 Dodge 350 Ram Van going straight in the northbound lane.  V2 was a 1992 Toyota Camry sedan traveling south in the southbound lane.  V2 made a left turn in front of V1 and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  The impact rotated V2 180 degrees and came to final rest in the northbound lane.  V1 came to final rest against the apex of the northeast curb.  ",
        "The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway in an intersection controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were dusk with rain in the evening on a weekday.  Both roads had a posted speed limit of 56 Kph (35 MPH).V1 was a 2005 Dodge Stratus Sedan and was traveling westbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 1993 Chevy Corsica Sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2 made a complete stop at the stop sign, then continued through the intersection and struck the left side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northwest.A 25-year-old male who was not injured drove V1.  He stated that he was driving westbound when V2 came out from the intersection and struck his vehicle on the left side.  V1 was traveling approximately 56 Kph (35MPH) at the time of impact.  He did not have time to take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available."

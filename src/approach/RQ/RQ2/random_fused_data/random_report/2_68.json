        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a signalized one-way roadway and a two-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was daylight and the roadway was dry and had a downhill grade of -2/61.Vehicle # 1 was a 1999 International M/H Truck that was traveling westbound on the middle lane of the roadway.  Vehicle # 2 was a 2002 Saturn SL that was traveling westbound on the right lane.  Vehicle # 1 was making a right turn at the intersection when he was impacted on the right side by the front of Vehicle # 1.The International truck (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 29 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The passenger in the front right seating position also did not sustain any injuries.  The International truck was not towed due to damage.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a 6-lane asphalt constructed roadway. At the area of this crash there is a three-legged intersection with a business driveway on the south side. This roadway runs east to west with three lanes on the westbound and two lanes for the eastbound traffic. There is a center left turn only lane and the posted speed limit is 64 kmph (45 mph). The north side entrance road has two lanes and is stop sign controlled. The south side business entrance is not regulated and has a driveway type entrance. This crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or sight line obstructions.Vehicle one (V1) was a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup driven by a 85 year-old male.  V1 was eastbound and entered into the center left turn lane intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1985 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan driven by a 18 year-old male.  V2 was traveling westbound in the #3 lane approaching the intersection. As V1 entered the left turn lane it slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear. As a group of vehicles passed, V1 turned left. As V1 crossed into the westbound #3 lane it was impacted on the right side with the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to a rest on the northwest corner of this intersection.  V2 had locked up its brakes prior to the impact but could not avoid V1. V2 was disabled and towed from the scene.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

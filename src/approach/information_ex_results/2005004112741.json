    "description": "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a three-lane T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the late afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 45 MPH with a 5% downhill grade and a curve-left.       V1 was a 2004 Jeep Cherokee SUV traveling westbound in the right travel lane approaching the T-intersection intending on turning left.  V2, a 1990 Mitsubishi Galant sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane intending on going straight.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V2 in the eastbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southbound and V2 came to final rest facing eastbound."

It was daylight and the roadway was straight and level and it was clear with patches of ice that formed from the night before.  The speed limit was 48kph (30mph).  \tVehicle #1, a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria, was traveling westbound on the two-way roadway.  Vehicle #2, a 1993 Ford Crown Victoria, was traveling northbound on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #2 contacted the left side of Vehicle #1.  Vehicle #1 then struck a pedestrian standing on the northwest corner of the intersection.  The pedestrian sustained no injuries.\tThe 1999 Ford Crown Victoria was driven by a 48-year old male who sustained no injuries and was not transported to the hospital.  The vehicle was used as a livery taxicab, and he was transporting one passenger.  He stated that he had the green light and was trying to avoid Vehicle #2 by steering right.

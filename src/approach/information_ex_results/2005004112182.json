    "description": "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane, T-intersection roadway.  Conditions were daylight and dry at 8:58 am on a Monday afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and was level.  There was a road department truck in the center of the double-yellow line approximately 100-150 feet north from point of impact.     V1 was a 1994 Dodge 350 Ram Van going straight in the northbound lane.  V2 was a 1992 Toyota Camry sedan traveling south in the southbound lane.  V2 made a left turn in front of V1 and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  The impact rotated V2 180 degrees and came to final rest in the northbound lane.  V1 came to final rest against the apex of the northeast curb.  "

Both roads had a posted speed limit of 56 Kph (35 MPH).V1 was a 2005 Dodge Stratus Sedan and was traveling westbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 1993 Chevy Corsica Sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2 made a complete stop at the stop sign, then continued through the intersection and struck the left side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northwest.A 25-year-old male who was not injured drove V1.  He stated that he was driving westbound when V2 came out from the intersection and struck his vehicle on the left side.  V1 was traveling approximately 56 Kph (35MPH) at the time of impact.  He did not have time to take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage."

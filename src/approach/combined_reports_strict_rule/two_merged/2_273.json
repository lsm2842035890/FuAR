        "\tV1, a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, was traveling northbound on a three-lane, two way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions. The posted speed limit for V1 was 56 kmph (35 mph). V1 was traveling in the center left turn lane approaching a T-intersection.  V1 was intending to turn left.  V2, a 1996 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling southbound on the same roadway.  The posted speed limit for V2 was 72 kmph (45 mph). V2 was also approaching the intersection, intending to go straight.  The driver of V1 claimed that she had looked but did not see V2 before turning.  The front of V2 contacted the right front side of V1, and then both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway. \tThe driver of V1 was an 80-year old woman who reported that she had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  She had a history of high blood pressure and had taken medication for it prior to the crash.  She was rested and traveling to a restaurant.  She was wearing her prescribed lenses that corrected a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition.  She sustained minor injuries in the crash and was treated on scene, but refused to be transported to a local trauma facility.\tThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was this vehicle turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a recognition error: inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see) because she stated that she did not see V2 before initiating her turn.",
        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight, dry in the early afternoon on a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 81 KPH (50 MPH) and the northbound lane had a positive 3% grade. V2 was a 1992 Ford Escort coupe intending on going straight through the intersection with a green light in the southbound lane.  V1 was a 1999 Chevy Venture minivan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a red light.  V1 was in the northbound lane.  As V1 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  As a result of the impact, V1 rolled \u00bc turn onto its left side coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading southwest. A 33-year-old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but was not transported.    He stated that the light was red as he was turning left.  He saw V2 but thought he was going to stop. After V2 hit V1 the vehicle rolled \u00bc turn on its left side.  V1 was traveling less than 8 KPH (5 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

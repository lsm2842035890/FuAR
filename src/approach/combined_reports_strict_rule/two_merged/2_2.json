        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-lane roadway controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 25 MPH.    V1 was a 2003 Saturn LW 300 station wagon traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 2004 Ford Explorer SUV, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  V1 drove thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the intersection.  V2 then struck a curb.  V1 and V2 came to final rest facing northeast.     V1 was driven by a 56-year-old female who sustained minor injuries but was not transported.  She stated that she was not familiar with this roadway.  As she approached the intersection she was distracted by an ambulance and did not see the stop sign.  She failed to stop for the TCD and struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 21-30 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  Conditions were daylight with rain in the morning on a weekday.  Both lanes had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).       V1 was a 2003 Kia Rio sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching the intersection with a blinking beacon light.  V2, a 2002 Honda Civic sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection.  V1 made a left turn in front of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  The two vehicles then side-slapped the front right bumper of V1 hit the right rear wheel rim of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing west.  V2 came to final rest facing northeast.      V1 was driven by a 44-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she thought that V2 was turning so she made a left turn in front of V2.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

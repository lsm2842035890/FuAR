        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-lane roadway controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 25 MPH.    V1 was a 2003 Saturn LW 300 station wagon traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 2004 Ford Explorer SUV, was traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the same intersection intending on going straight.  V1 drove thru the intersection and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the intersection.  V2 then struck a curb.  V1 and V2 came to final rest facing northeast.     V1 was driven by a 56-year-old female who sustained minor injuries but was not transported.  She stated that she was not familiar with this roadway.  As she approached the intersection she was distracted by an ambulance and did not see the stop sign.  She failed to stop for the TCD and struck the front of V2 in the intersection.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 21-30 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This 2-vehicle crash occurred in the evening at a T-intersection in a suburban neighborhood. A 2-lane roadway runs east and west with an intersecting road that runs north and south. Both roadways have a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) and each are controlled by a stop sign at the intersection where the crash took place. The conditions were dusk, clear, dry and the traffic level was moderate. V1, a 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo 4 x4 with one occupant, was traveling east in lane one of 2-lane undivided road approaching an intersecting road to its right. V2, a 1997 Honda CR-V with one occupant, was stopped (facing north) at the intersection waiting to turn left (westbound.) Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and collided at a right angle. The front of the Honda CR-V (V2) struck the right side of the Jeep Cherokee (V1) causing it to roll 2-quarter turns to its left and coming to rest on its roof. V1 had to be towed from the scene due to damage but V2 was driven away.V1 was driven by a 25-year-old female without a driver license. She did not speak English but her bilingual boyfriend/husband did speak English and he refused to help with the interview. The investigating officer said she was not cooperative with him or the EMS either, but she reportedly claimed the brakes failed. Once the vehicle was rolled back onto its tires, it was towed to the owner's house without the brakes ever being checked.  "

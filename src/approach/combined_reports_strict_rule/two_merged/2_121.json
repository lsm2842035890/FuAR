        "     The crash occurred on a two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 48 KPH (30 MPH) and a -2.2% grade.  There was an intersecting driveway to the right with a -13.3% grade.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this early morning weekday crash.     Vehicle 1, a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway approaching the driveway.  It should be noted that there was a large sign, small hill and telephone pole to this driver's right, which may have obscured the approach of Vehicle 2.  Vehicle 2, a 2000 Toyota Corolla, was traveling west on the driveway approaching the main roadway.  Vehicle 2 entered the main roadway and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 was rotated counterclockwise off the left side of the roadway, over a small curb, onto a private lawn and came to rest facing east.  Vehicle 1 continued and came to rest in the southbound lane facing north.     The Chevrolet Blazer (Vehicle 1) was driven by a belted 50-year-old male who was transported, treated and released for a complaint of pain.  Vehicle 1 was traveling north on the roadway and saw Vehicle 2 coming down the driveway off to the right.  He put on his brakes and steered right but hit Vehicle 2 on the left side.  Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.",

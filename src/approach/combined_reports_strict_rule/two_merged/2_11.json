The posted speed limit for both roads was 40 kmph (25 mph).     V1 was a 2005 Toyota Matrix hatchback traveling westbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 2005 Hyundai Accent coupe, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection with a stop sign.  V2 did not stop at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the intersection.  V1 then rolled 6-quarter rolls and came to final rest on its roof facing eastbound.  V2 came to final rest facing northwest.     V1 was driven by a 31-year-old male who was transported with moderate injuries to a local hospital prior to our arrival.  V1 was towed due to damage.

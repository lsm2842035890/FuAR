        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a five-lane intersection with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  Both roads had a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 MPH).     V1 was a 1998 Pontiac Bonneville sedan traveling southbound in the right lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2004 Dodge Durango SUV, was traveling westbound in the right lane intending on continuing straight when an unknown vehicle supposedly cut in front of V2, which made V2 run the red light.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in the westbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing north and V2 came to final rest facing northwest.       V1 was driven by a 44-year old female who was not injured.  The driver of V1 was contacted several times to be interviewed but did not respond back.  V1 was towed due to damage.",

        "The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry and EMS was dispatched in the early evening of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and a 1% uphill grade.V1 was a 2002 Lexus RX 300 SUV that was initially traveling before coming to a complete stop at the intersection and intending on turning left.  V2 was a 1994 Ford Taurus sedan directly in back of V2 intending on going straight.  The driver of V2 was looking to the left then looked straight ahead.  V2 tried to steer left and brake to avoid V1.  The front of V2 struck the back of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing west.",
        "    The crash occurred at the T-intersection of an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane local road.  The arterial curves to the south (left) as it approaches the intersection from the east with a radius of curvature of 375m.  Traffic counts indicate it carries 9,036 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).  The local road is straight and is controlled by a stop sign with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph).  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.    Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with four horses westbound on the two lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound on the local road.  Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn to go east when its left side was struck by the front of Vehicle #1.   After impact the F-250 (V1) rotated counterclockwise and jackknifed with the truck coming to rest partially off the south side of the intersection facing southeast.  The trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest.  The Corolla (V2) rotated clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not injured in the crash.    She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection.  However, she didn't believe the Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance.  Once she realized Vehicle #2 was beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision.  "

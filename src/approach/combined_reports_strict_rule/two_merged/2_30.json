        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dusk and dry in the evening on a weekend.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and the eastbound lane had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Hyundai Elantra sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection.  V2, a 1998 Ford Taurus sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left.  V2 stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions but there was landscaping and a fence obstructing V2's view.  V2 then proceeded to turn left and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in the intersection., as V1 passed by V2, V2's right front contacted the back of V1.  V1 continued on and struck a curb and a tree.  V1 came to final rest facing eastbound.  V2 continued on and struck a curb and came to final rest facing northwest.",
        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction and a one-way roadway with one lane of travel.  The roadway was straight and level, and had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device; the southbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. It was dark but lighted, and clear with no adverse conditions.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Lexus SC430 traveling eastbound on the two-way roadway and Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Lexus LS400 traveling south on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right side of Vehicle #2.  The front of Vehicle #1 then impacted a light-pole on the southeast corner of the intersection.  The Lexus SC430 (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 45-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 ran the stop sign and caused him to impact Vehicle #2 and then into the light-pole.  He stated that he did not perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The Lexus SC430 was towed due to damage.  "

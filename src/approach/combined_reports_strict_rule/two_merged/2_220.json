This crash occurred on a weekend afternoon.Vehicle #1, a red 2003 Buick Century, was traveling south on the two-lane undivided roadway negotiating a curve to the right when it went over the left side double yellow lines into the northbound lane. Vehicle #2, a white 1992 Nissan Sentra, was traveling north on the same roadway negotiating the same curve. Vehicle #1 impacted the front left of Vehicle #2 with its front left. Vehicle #1 spun counter-clockwise and came to rest facing north on the southbound shoulder. Vehicle #2 spun counter-clockwise and came to rest on the northbound shoulder facing south.The Buick Century (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 58-year old female who was airlifted to a trauma center and hospitalized due to left leg and abdominal injuries. She stated that she could not remember the actual crash but does remember talking with her passenger and then waking up to see dirt, a broken window and the airbag. The right front passenger in this vehicle was a relative of the driver, a belted 80-year old male with a previous diagnosis of dementia. He was transported to an area hospital. The driver of this vehicle takes several medications for diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression. She also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea. Possible side effects of these medications include drowsiness and lethargy. It should be noted here that a witness described this driver as looking \"like she fell asleep.\"  Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage."

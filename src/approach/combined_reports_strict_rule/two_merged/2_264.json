        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way roadway that is divided by a center median with three lanes in each direction.  It was daylight and clear and the ground was wet from a previous rainstorm.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph). V1 was a 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML320 that was stopped for the Traffic control device when it was rear-ended by V2, a 1996 Toyota Corolla.  Both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway.V1 was driven by a 42 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries and was unable to be located for an interview.  V1 was driven away before it could be inspected.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a 6-lane asphalt constructed roadway. At the area of this crash there is a three-legged intersection with a business driveway on the south side. This roadway runs east to west with three lanes on the westbound and two lanes for the eastbound traffic. There is a center left turn only lane and the posted speed limit is 64 kmph (45 mph). The north side entrance road has two lanes and is stop sign controlled. The south side business entrance is not regulated and has a driveway type entrance. This crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or sight line obstructions.Vehicle one (V1) was a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup driven by a 85 year-old male.  V1 was eastbound and entered into the center left turn lane intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1985 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan driven by a 18 year-old male.  V2 was traveling westbound in the #3 lane approaching the intersection. As V1 entered the left turn lane it slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear. As a group of vehicles passed, V1 turned left. As V1 crossed into the westbound #3 lane it was impacted on the right side with the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to a rest on the northwest corner of this intersection.  V2 had locked up its brakes prior to the impact but could not avoid V1. V2 was disabled and towed from the scene.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

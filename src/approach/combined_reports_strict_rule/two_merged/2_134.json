        "This crash occurred in the left lane of a one-way roadway.  The roadway was straight and level, and it was clear with no adverse conditions.  It was dark but lighted and the roadway had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 2 was a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara that was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and slowed down for an emergency fire truck with the emergency lights and sirens attempting to go eastbound on a two-way roadway.  Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.  The Lincoln Navigator (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 27-year old male who sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a medical facility.  The Lincoln was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  Conditions were daylight with rain in the morning on a weekday.  Both lanes had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).       V1 was a 2003 Kia Rio sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching the intersection with a blinking beacon light.  V2, a 2002 Honda Civic sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection.  V1 made a left turn in front of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  The two vehicles then side-slapped the front right bumper of V1 hit the right rear wheel rim of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing west.  V2 came to final rest facing northeast.      V1 was driven by a 44-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she thought that V2 was turning so she made a left turn in front of V2.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

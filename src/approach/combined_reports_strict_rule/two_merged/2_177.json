        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane T-intersection.  Conditions were cloudy and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The westbound road had a posted speed limit of 50 MPH and the southbound road had a posted speed limit of 25 MPH and was controlled by a stop sign.     V1 was a 1985 Chevy Celebrity sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left at the T-intersection.  V2, a 1995 Dodge Neon sedan, was traveling westbound in the right lane intending on continuing straight.  An unknown vehicle was traveling westbound on the same roadway and turned right onto the road where V1 originally was.  V1 then turned left and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles then side-slapped left to right and came to final rest facing southwest.  ",

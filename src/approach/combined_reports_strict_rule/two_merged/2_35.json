        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dusk and dry in the evening on a weekend.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and the eastbound lane had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Hyundai Elantra sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection.  V2, a 1998 Ford Taurus sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left.  V2 stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions but there was landscaping and a fence obstructing V2's view.  V2 then proceeded to turn left and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in the intersection., as V1 passed by V2, V2's right front contacted the back of V1.  V1 continued on and struck a curb and a tree.  V1 came to final rest facing eastbound.  V2 continued on and struck a curb and came to final rest facing northwest.",
        "     The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a T-intersection with a grass median.  There was one northbound left-turn only lane with a traffic control and two eastbound lanes with the same traffic control signal.  Conditions were overcast with rain with light fog in the early afternoon of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 45 MPH.     Vehicle 1 was a 1988 Mercedes Benz 300SL stopped for the traffic control intending on turning left.  Vehicle 2 was a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer driving eastbound in the right lane approaching the traffic control.  The light for the Mercedes turned green and the vehicle started turning left when the front of the Mercury struck the left-front corner of the Mercedes.  The Mercedes rotated CCW 90 degrees and the vehicle's final rest was facing east in the eastbound lane.  Final rest for the Mercury was facing east in the eastbound lane as well. "

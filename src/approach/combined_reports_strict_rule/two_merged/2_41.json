        "The crash occurred in the intersection of two one-way roadways.  Both roadways had one lane of travel and were straight and level.  The speed limit was 48kmph (30mph) and it was clear with no adverse conditions.Vehicle # 1 was a 2005 Infiniti FX35 that was traveling southbound on a one-way roadway.  Vehicle # 2 was a 1993 Ford F-250 Pick-up truck that was traveling westbound on a one-way roadway, which was controlled by a stop sign.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the right side of Vehicle # 2, and then the left side of Vehicle # 2 impacted the right side of Vehicle # 1.  Vehicle # 1 then departed the roadway on the left side and then impacted a fence and came to a final rest after impacting the side of the building.The Infiniti FX35 (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 45 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver of this vehicle declined to participate in the study.  Vehicle # 1 was towed due to damage.",

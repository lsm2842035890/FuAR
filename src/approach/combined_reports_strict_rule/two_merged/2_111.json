        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. It was not physically divided, and had a traffic-control device for this 'T' intersection. The conditions were as follows: late evening, clear skies, the roadway was dry and there were no atmospheric conditions. The gradient for the two vehicles involved were both on a -2% roadway. The posted speed limit for vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was a 2005 Toyota Tundra, traveling southbound. V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper. The driver side airbags for V1 inflated, and the driver was wearing his seatbelt. The impact caused V1 to push V2 further down the roadway. V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was able to be driven from the scene. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as other motor vehicle in lane and was stopped. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event is internal distraction - a driver error. In the PAR the driver stated that items in the front seat area started to fall. He took his eyes off the road to look at the items and when he looked back it was too late to stop. After numerous attempts to try and attain an interview, they were unsuccessful.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred at a T type intersection in a rural area. The crash happened where a north/south two-lane road intersects with an east/west two-lane road. The conditions were clear, dry, daylight and both roadways had posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).V1, a 1998 Plymouth Voyager with three occupants, was traveling south approaching the intersecting road. V2, a 2001 Saturn SL2 with one occupant was traveling east approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection and collided at a right angle. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2 and subsequently side slapped. V1 departed the left side of the road and struck a street sign and mailbox. V1 came to final rest on the southeast roadside and V2 came to rest on the south roadside. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.V1 was driven by a 30-year-old female that was traveling this afternoon in her 1998 Plymouth Voyager with her husband and two young sons. She was returning home after buying some paint and completing some other errands. As she drove south on a 2-lane undivided road, she noticed ahead of her a white Saturn at an intersecting road begin to \"inch\" forward. As this driver got closer to the intersection, she could see the Saturn still slowly moving forward, so she took her foot off the accelerator. Finally, the Saturn coming from this driver's right side, turned left in front of her as she entered the intersection. This driver said she tried to swerve left, around the car, but was not able to avoid the crash. The front of her minivan struck the left side of the Saturn, departed the left side of the road, struck a mailbox, and came to final rest on the front lawn of a home. This driver received a small scratch to her right thigh after striking the keys hanging from her ignition. She was not treated and none of her passengers were injured. "

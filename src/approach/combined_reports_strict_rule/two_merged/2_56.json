        "       This two-vehicle crash occurred in the morning at 0740 hours at a traffic-signal-controlled T-intersection. The north/south roadway is straight, level, dry and has two lanes in each direction that are separated by a painted median. The intersecting roadway (that branches on the west side of the north/south road) is a two-lane, undivided, level, straight east/west roadway. The speed limit on both roadways is 48 kph (30 mph) and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.       Vehicle one,(V 1) a 1992 Cadillac Deville, was southbound in the second lane. Vehicle two,(V 2) a 1993 Ford F-150 pickup truck, was eastbound at the intersection. The light turned red for vehicle one and green for vehicle two. As vehicle two turned left at the intersection, the front of vehicle one struck the left side vehicle two. Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection and were towed due to damage. The driver of V 1 a forty-six-year-old female, disregarded the red traffic signal. No information was obtained from this driver. The driver of V 2 a twenty-year-old male, was driving from home to work. He was well rested, familiar with his vehicle and his route, not in a hurry and comfortable with his twenty-year-old male passenger. He was listening to the radio, but this did not distract him from his driving responsibilities.       The pre-event movement for V 1 coded going straight, category this vehicle traveling crossing over passing through intersection. Critical reason driver related factor \"illegal maneuver\" (disregard of traffic control signal).",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours a traffic light controlled, three-legged intersection. The east/west roadway is divided, straight, level and the westbound lanes consist of one right turn lane, two through lanes and a left turn lane into a private driveway. The north/south roadway is divided and is a controlled-access highway ramp; in the southbound direction, the lanes are straight and downhill. The speed limit for both roadways is 56 kmph (35 mph) and it was raining at the time of the crash.Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Mazda Protege was southbound on the exit ramp from an interstate in lane two, the left turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Mercury Sable, was westbound in lane two, the right through lane. The driver of V1 thought she had the green light and started to make a left turn. V2, who actually had the green light, proceeded into the intersection and the front struck the left side of V1. V1 was pushed slightly clockwise and came to rest facing southwest in the middle of the intersection. V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest next to V1 facing southwest in the middle of the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage.The driver of V1, a forty-two-year-old female, was driving from her home to an RV park to visit a friend. She was familiar with the route and the vehicle. She took ibuprofen and an unknown brand of medication for a sinus headache several hours prior to the crash. She claimed that she had a green light, that \"the light usually stays red for 10 years.\"  "

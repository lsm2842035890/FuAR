        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the evening hours in the middle of the two northbound lanes of a physically divided (concrete barrier) bridge.  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, although it was dark and no streetlights were present.  The roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of the roadway was 72kph (45mph).  V1, a 2005 Mazda 626, was northbound in lane one on the bridge.  V2, a 1995 Ford Windstar, was disabled on the bridge in lane one ahead of vehicle one.  V1 failed to stop and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2 the impact pushed V2 forward and its right side contacted the right concrete barrier before coming to final rest.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to vehicle damage.V1 was driven by a 22 year-old female who suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision, but did not require transport to a medical facility.  After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of vehicle one.  From statements given to the police on scene the driver of V1 had consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the crash but sobriety tests confirmed she was still within the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "       The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane intersection controlled by a stop sign.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).     V1 was a 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis sedan traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the intersection controlled by a stop sign.  V2, a 2003 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane intending on going straight.  V1 stopped at the stop sign looked both ways but did not see V2.  The front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the northbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing northbound and V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 70-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he stopped at the stop sign, looked both ways and proceeded thru the intersection.  He did not see V2 at all.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage."

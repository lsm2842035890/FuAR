        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available.",
        "The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry and EMS was dispatched in the early evening of a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 40 MPH and a 1% uphill grade.V1 was a 2002 Lexus RX 300 SUV that was initially traveling before coming to a complete stop at the intersection and intending on turning left.  V2 was a 1994 Ford Taurus sedan directly in back of V2 intending on going straight.  The driver of V2 was looking to the left then looked straight ahead.  V2 tried to steer left and brake to avoid V1.  The front of V2 struck the back of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing west."

        "This two-vehicle crash occurred at a T type intersection in a rural area. The crash happened where a north/south two-lane road intersects with an east/west two-lane road. The conditions were clear, dry, daylight and both roadways had posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).V1, a 1998 Plymouth Voyager with three occupants, was traveling south approaching the intersecting road. V2, a 2001 Saturn SL2 with one occupant was traveling east approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection and collided at a right angle. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2 and subsequently side slapped. V1 departed the left side of the road and struck a street sign and mailbox. V1 came to final rest on the southeast roadside and V2 came to rest on the south roadside. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.V1 was driven by a 30-year-old female that was traveling this afternoon in her 1998 Plymouth Voyager with her husband and two young sons. She was returning home after buying some paint and completing some other errands. As she drove south on a 2-lane undivided road, she noticed ahead of her a white Saturn at an intersecting road begin to \"inch\" forward. As this driver got closer to the intersection, she could see the Saturn still slowly moving forward, so she took her foot off the accelerator. Finally, the Saturn coming from this driver's right side, turned left in front of her as she entered the intersection. This driver said she tried to swerve left, around the car, but was not able to avoid the crash. The front of her minivan struck the left side of the Saturn, departed the left side of the road, struck a mailbox, and came to final rest on the front lawn of a home. This driver received a small scratch to her right thigh after striking the keys hanging from her ignition. She was not treated and none of her passengers were injured. ",
        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight, dry in the early afternoon on a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 81 KPH (50 MPH) and the northbound lane had a positive 3% grade. V2 was a 1992 Ford Escort coupe intending on going straight through the intersection with a green light in the southbound lane.  V1 was a 1999 Chevy Venture minivan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a red light.  V1 was in the northbound lane.  As V1 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  As a result of the impact, V1 rolled \u00bc turn onto its left side coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading southwest. A 33-year-old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but was not transported.    He stated that the light was red as he was turning left.  He saw V2 but thought he was going to stop. After V2 hit V1 the vehicle rolled \u00bc turn on its left side.  V1 was traveling less than 8 KPH (5 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

        "\tV1, a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, was traveling northbound on a three-lane, two way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions. The posted speed limit for V1 was 56 kmph (35 mph). V1 was traveling in the center left turn lane approaching a T-intersection.  V1 was intending to turn left.  V2, a 1996 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling southbound on the same roadway.  The posted speed limit for V2 was 72 kmph (45 mph). V2 was also approaching the intersection, intending to go straight.  The driver of V1 claimed that she had looked but did not see V2 before turning.  The front of V2 contacted the right front side of V1, and then both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway. \tThe driver of V1 was an 80-year old woman who reported that she had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  She had a history of high blood pressure and had taken medication for it prior to the crash.  She was rested and traveling to a restaurant.  She was wearing her prescribed lenses that corrected a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition.  She sustained minor injuries in the crash and was treated on scene, but refused to be transported to a local trauma facility.\tThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was this vehicle turning left at intersection.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a recognition error: inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see) because she stated that she did not see V2 before initiating her turn.",
        "\tV1, a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup, was traveling eastbound on a three-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions.  V1 was approaching a T-intersection intending to turn right.  V2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling southbound on a four-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway approaching the same intersection.  V2 was intending to go straight.  The posted speed for both roadways was 89 kmph (55 mph). Eastbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign; south and northbound traffic had no traffic control device. V1 stopped at the stop sign for 10 seconds or more.  V1 then made a right-hand turn.  The front of V2 contacted the left of V1 before they both came to final rest in the roadway.\tThe driver of V1 was a 68-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to the store.  He did not wear corrective lenses.  He was uninjured in the crash and refused treatment.  \tThe Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning right at intersection.  The Critical reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a recognition error: inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see) because he stated that he had looked both ways but did not see V2."

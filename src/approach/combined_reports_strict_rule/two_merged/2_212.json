        "This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway.  There were no vehicle traffic control signals present for this particular stretch of roadway.   The road had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).  It had just started to rain slightly but the road was still considered dry at the time of the incident.  The gradient for this trafficway was measured to be level.  Vehicle one (V1) and Vehicle two (V2) were both light vehicles.  V1, a 2002 Honda Civic, was approaching V2, a 1980 Dodge Aspen, at approximately 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph), heading in the same direction.  V2 was stopped on the roadway waiting to make a left turn into a private driveway.  The left front of V1 made contact with the rear right of V2.  The impact caused V2 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to final rest in the entranceway of a daycare center.  V1 continued forward before coming to final rest in its original lane of travel.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage.The driver of V1, a 69-year old female, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the impact.  The interview with the driver of V1 did not yield much information.  She was not really sure what the reason for this crash was.  She claimed that there was another car directly in front of her vehicle and behind V2.  She stated that the car in front of hers went around V2, which was waiting to make a left hand turn into a daycare center.  As soon as she realized the impending danger she hit the brakes.  This action was unfortunately not enough to prevent the crash from occurring.  The driver of V1 claimed to be in good health; however, she was taking some prescription medication.  One prescription was a hormone-replacement medication and the other medication was a thyroid-replacement medication.  No deviance from the driver's normal sleep pattern was noted, and she claimed to be well rested at the time of the incident.  Further, no emotional stresses were believed to be a factor in this crash.  She was wearing her prescription lenses that corrected both hyperopic and myopic vision conditions. The Critical Precrash Event for this driver was when another motor vehicle was stopped in her lane.  The Critical Reason was coded as an \"other\" recognition error - driver focused on extraneous vehicle. The driver kept watching the vehicle she had been following as it swerved around V2. The weather was also coded as an associated factor - it was drizzling at the time of the crash.",
        "        \tThis crash occurred just after the noon time hour where the entrance ramp from a north/south interstate merges with the eastbound lanes of another interstate.  The ramp had a 5% down hill grade with a 160.9 radius of curvature to the right.  The eastbound lanes were straight and level.  It was lightly raining and the roadways were wet.  The speed for the ramp was posted at 113 kmph (70mph) with an advisory speed of 64kmph (40mph) and the interstate lanes had a speed of 113 kmph (70mph).  As V1, a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, was negotiating the right curve of the ramp (traveling between 51-60 mph) it lost control and began rotating clockwise.  The driver then attempted to regain control which caused his vehicle to rotate counter-clockwise crossing the two lane lines to the left before contacting the right rear corner of V2, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. V2 rotated clockwise one complete rotation swerving across three lanes of traffic before coming to final rest off the road in the ditch on the south side of the interstate.  V1 after contacting V2 rotated clockwise and then contacted the center median wall with the front of the vehicle. Then rotated counter-clockwise to contact the median wall with the right back corner of the vehicle before rolling to final rest in lane two of the interstate.             \tV1 was driven by a 20 year-old male in very good health on his way home from a relative's house. The driver stated as he negotiated the down hill curve the rear of his vehicle rotated clockwise and as he attempted to counter steered he lost control of his vehicle crossing all lanes of travel to contact V2 then contacted the center wall of the interstate.  The driver was uninjured and his vehicle was towed due to damage.The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related error- decision Error, too fast for conditions (too fast on a wet, curved road).  The associated factors were the speed of the vehicle, the wet roads, and low tread depth of the rear tires. "

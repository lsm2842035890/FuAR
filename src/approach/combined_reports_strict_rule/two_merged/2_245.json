        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available.",
        "     The crash occurred on a level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 55 MPH (89 KPH).  The road was curved left with a radius of curvature of 375 meters and a superelevation of 1.8% for Vehicle #2. The road was curved right with a radius of curvature of 1875 meters and no superelevation for Vehicle #1.  Both vehicles had black on yellow curve warning signs with a suggested speed of 50 MPH.  The weather was cloudy.     Vehicle #1, a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier, was traveling west on the two-lane roadway negotiating a curve to the right approaching a driveway.  Vehicle #2, a 1995 Dodge Intrepid, was traveling east on the same roadway negotiating the curve to the left.  Vehicle #1 attempted a left hand turn into the driveway and was struck in the front by Vehicle #2's front.  Vehicle #1 was rotated counterclockwise back across both lanes and came to rest in the westbound lane facing east.  Vehicle #2 continued off the right side of the roadway, came back on the roadway crossed both lanes, off the north side of the road and struck a 25cm pole with its front.  Vehicle #2 came to rest facing in a northerly direction.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.     The Chevrolet Cavalier (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 80 year old male who was transported, treated and released for minor injuries.  The right front seat passenger was a belted 72-year-old female who was also transported, treated and released for minor injuries. Both driver and passenger airbags deployed. The interview was refused and no information obtained from the driver. "

        "   This crash occurred on a level two-lane undivided straight roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 KMPH (40 MPH).  Many driveways for retail establishments intersect with the roadway. There is a side road with a control device with a pedestrian signal, which was mentioned by the drivers of both vehicles, 100 meters north of the crash site. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling south on the two lane undivided roadway. Vehicle #2 pulled out from a fast food establishment's driveway making a left turn in front of Vehicle #1. Vehicle #1 impacted the left front corner of Vehicle #2 with its front right. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway facing their intended directions.    The 2000 Pontiac Grand Am (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 16-year old belted female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released. The vehicle was pushed out of the roadway to a parking lot and then towed from the scene."

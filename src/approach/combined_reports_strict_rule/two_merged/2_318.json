        "\tThe crash occurred at a three-legged intersection in the eastbound lane of a two-lane suburban roadway.  The northbound road approaching the intersection was controlled by a stop sign and had a 4% downhill grade.  The eastbound road curved left at the intersection and had a 3% downhill grade.  The roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), though the crash occurred during a 40 kmph (25 mph) school zone time.  Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies.  The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours of a weekday.  \tVehicle one was a 1991 Acura Integra 3-door hatchback traveling east in lane one.  Vehicle two was a 2000 Honda Civic coupe stopped facing north.  V1 continued through the intersection while V2 proceeded to attempt a left turn.  The two vehicles struck head on.  Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection.  \tV1 was driven by an 18-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with possible injuries.  She stated that it appeared V2 was trying to follow a friend driving in front of V2 who had just completed a left turn in front of this driver.  V2 tried to pull out quickly in front of this driver but mistimed her maneuver.  This driver estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 40 kmph (25 mph), saying she didn't have a chance to slow down.  V1 was towed due to damage. ",
        "    The crash occurred at a T-intersection of an east/west two lane arterial road and a two lane residential road that intersected from the south.  The arterial road was straight with a 4% downgrade and had shoulders.  Traffic counts indicate that it carries 17,888 vehicles per day.  The residential road was straight with a 3% upgrade and was controlled by a stop sign.  The posted speed for the arterial was 56kmph (35mph); the residential road's speed limit was 48kmph (30mph).  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.      Vehicle #1 was a 1998 Ford Taurus traveling north on the two lane residential road.  Vehicle #2, a 2002 Honda Odyssey, was eastbound on the two lane arterial.  Vehicle #1 stopped at the intersection and attempted to turn left to go west on the two-lane arterial when its left side was struck by the front of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact in the intersection.  The Taurus (V1) was towed due to damage; the Odyssey (V1) was driven from the scene.  No one was treated for injuries in the collision.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 21-year-old female.  She, along with her 16-year-old passenger, were belted with no deployed airbags.  In her interview she reported that the minivan (V2) had its right turn signal on, however there was no evidence of this and her statement was not deemed credible.  Police charged her with failure to yield."

        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.",
        "   This crash occurred on a level two-lane undivided straight roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 KMPH (40 MPH).  Many driveways for retail establishments intersect with the roadway. There is a side road with a control device with a pedestrian signal, which was mentioned by the drivers of both vehicles, 100 meters north of the crash site. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling south on the two lane undivided roadway. Vehicle #2 pulled out from a fast food establishment's driveway making a left turn in front of Vehicle #1. Vehicle #1 impacted the left front corner of Vehicle #2 with its front right. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway facing their intended directions.    The 2000 Pontiac Grand Am (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 16-year old belted female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released. The vehicle was pushed out of the roadway to a parking lot and then towed from the scene."

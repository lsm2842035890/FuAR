        "This 2-vehicle crash occurred within a \"T\" type intersection in a rural area during daylight hours while raining.  The straight three-lane east/westbound roadway included a center left turn lane and was on a slight downhill grade for westbound traffic.  The straight two-lane north/southbound roadway was on a steeper downhill grade for southbound traffic and was controlled by a stop sign.  Both roadways were asphalt constructed and wet at the time of the crash. The speed limit for the through roadway was 80 kph (50 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero sedan driven by a 20 year-old female with one passenger was traveling southbound beginning a left hand turn (eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup driven by a 66 year-old male was traveling westbound in the #1 lane when the driver saw V1 beginning to pull out from the side street.  The driver of V2 tapped on his brakes and steered left slightly but could not avoid V1 because of oncoming traffic.  The front of V2 struck the front of V1. At impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north off the right side of the traffic lane in the intersection. V2 came to rest in the center turn lane facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene after the flat tire was changed.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).  The driver was not aware of V2's presence until she had already entered the intersection.  The driver was inattentive due to thinking about financial problems.  An illegal maneuver was coded as an associative factor due to ignoring the traffic control.  This driver slowed to approximately 5 mph before entering the intersection and attempting a left turn. If she had stopped at the stop sign she may have detected V2 before entering the intersection.",
        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a four-lane roadway with a median and a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the morning on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 KMPH (50 MPH).     V1 was a 1997 Toyota Corolla sedan traveling westbound in the 1st travel lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control signal intending on going straight.  V2, a 2003 Nissan Altima sedan, was decelerating in the 1st travel lane for the amber traffic control signal.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing westbound.     A 26-year-old male who was not injured drove V1.  He stated that he was in the right lane when the traffic control turned amber and he thought he had enough time to make a complete stop.  The driver of V1 braked but was unable to avoid V2.  V1 was traveling between 50-64 KMPH (31-40 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

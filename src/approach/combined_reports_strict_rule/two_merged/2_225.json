        "       The crash occurred in the left lane of a level two-lane roadway with a concrete median barrier (4 lanes total).  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies in the early evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 MPH).     V1 was a 1996 Chevy S10 pickup truck traveling southbound in the left lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 2005 Nissan Quest minivan, was traveling southbound directly in front of V1.  V2 was stopped when the front of V1 struck the rear of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing southbound.     A 17-year old male drove V1 and was not injured.  Both driver and parent of the driver refused to be interviewed.  V1 was driven away from the scene.",
        "The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of an undivided two-way roadway, with two lanes of travel in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was dark out but the roadway was lighted and it was dry.  Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Dodge Stratus, which was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the right lane.  Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Nissan Altima that was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway in the left lane.  On this roadway, Vehicle #1 was attempting to make a U-turn to travel northbound when it was contacted on its left plane by Vehicle #2's frontal plane. The crash occurred on a non-junction roadway with no traffic signs or signals. Both vehicles came to final rest on the sidewalk of the northbound lanes. "

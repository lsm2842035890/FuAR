        "    The crash occurred at the T-intersection of an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane local road.  The arterial curves to the south (left) as it approaches the intersection from the east with a radius of curvature of 375m.  Traffic counts indicate it carries 9,036 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).  The local road is straight and is controlled by a stop sign with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph).  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.    Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with four horses westbound on the two lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound on the local road.  Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn to go east when its left side was struck by the front of Vehicle #1.   After impact the F-250 (V1) rotated counterclockwise and jackknifed with the truck coming to rest partially off the south side of the intersection facing southeast.  The trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest.  The Corolla (V2) rotated clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not injured in the crash.    She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection.  However, she didn't believe the Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance.  Once she realized Vehicle #2 was beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision.  ",
        "This 2-vehicle crash occurred within a \"T\" type intersection in a rural area during daylight hours while raining.  The straight three-lane east/westbound roadway included a center left turn lane and was on a slight downhill grade for westbound traffic.  The straight two-lane north/southbound roadway was on a steeper downhill grade for southbound traffic and was controlled by a stop sign.  Both roadways were asphalt constructed and wet at the time of the crash. The speed limit for the through roadway was 80 kph (50 mph).Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero sedan driven by a 20 year-old female with one passenger was traveling southbound beginning a left hand turn (eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup driven by a 66 year-old male was traveling westbound in the #1 lane when the driver saw V1 beginning to pull out from the side street.  The driver of V2 tapped on his brakes and steered left slightly but could not avoid V1 because of oncoming traffic.  The front of V2 struck the front of V1. At impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north off the right side of the traffic lane in the intersection. V2 came to rest in the center turn lane facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene after the flat tire was changed.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).  The driver was not aware of V2's presence until she had already entered the intersection.  The driver was inattentive due to thinking about financial problems.  An illegal maneuver was coded as an associative factor due to ignoring the traffic control.  This driver slowed to approximately 5 mph before entering the intersection and attempting a left turn. If she had stopped at the stop sign she may have detected V2 before entering the intersection."

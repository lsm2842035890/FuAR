        "    The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west two-lane state secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane residential road.  The residential road intersected from the north to form the three-leg intersection and had a stop sign and a flashing red traffic signal.  Traffic on the arterial road had a flashing yellow caution signal in both directions at the intersection.  West of the intersection the arterial road is straight and level.  East of the intersection the arterial curves to the south with a radius of curvature of 141m and had a slight downgrade as it approached the intersection.  The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35mph).  Construction grading was underway on the south side of the road, the arterial was being widened to four lanes and straightened.  At the time of the crash no workers were present only materials that had been at the site for several months.  There are no construction warning signs since traffic is not affected by the roadwork.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Focus traveling east on the two-lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was westbound on the same road.   Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left on the two lane residential road and its front was struck by the front left of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.      Vehicle #1 was driven by a 48-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags and not injured in the crash.  She stated that the other vehicle slowed down and she assumed it was stopping at the intersection.  She drove the road monthly but felt the intersection was somewhat confusing.  ",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a 6-lane asphalt constructed roadway. At the area of this crash there is a three-legged intersection with a business driveway on the south side. This roadway runs east to west with three lanes on the westbound and two lanes for the eastbound traffic. There is a center left turn only lane and the posted speed limit is 64 kmph (45 mph). The north side entrance road has two lanes and is stop sign controlled. The south side business entrance is not regulated and has a driveway type entrance. This crash occurred during daylight with no adverse weather or sight line obstructions.Vehicle one (V1) was a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup driven by a 85 year-old male.  V1 was eastbound and entered into the center left turn lane intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1985 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan driven by a 18 year-old male.  V2 was traveling westbound in the #3 lane approaching the intersection. As V1 entered the left turn lane it slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear. As a group of vehicles passed, V1 turned left. As V1 crossed into the westbound #3 lane it was impacted on the right side with the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to a rest on the northwest corner of this intersection.  V2 had locked up its brakes prior to the impact but could not avoid V1. V2 was disabled and towed from the scene.The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.  The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."

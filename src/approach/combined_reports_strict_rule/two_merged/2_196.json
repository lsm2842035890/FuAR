        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.Vehicle # 1 was a 1994 Acura Vigor that was traveling eastbound.  Vehicle # 2 was a Lincoln Town Car that attempted to make a left turn into a gas station.  The front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the front of Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 then impacted the right side of Vehicle # 2 before coming to a final rest.The Acura Vigor (Vehicle # 1), was driven by a 47-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver stated that he was going straight when Vehicle # 2 attempted to turn in front of him.  The Acura Vigor was towed due to damage.",
        "   This crash took place on a two lane undivided roadway near a T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies shortly after noon on a weekend.  The roadway had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).   V1, a 1997 Chevrolet 300 conversion van, was traveling east on the roadway.  V2, a 1999 Infinity QX sport utility vehicle, was traveling west on the same roadway.  The vehicle traveling directly in front of V1 slowed quickly and to avoid making contact, the driver of V1 steered left, made a lane departure to the left, and this vehicle's right front made contact to the front right of V2.  The critical pre-crash event for V1 was when it traveled over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.  The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as an incorrect evasive action. One associated factor coded to the driver of V1 was inattention. He reported that he had been thinking about some concerns immediately before the crash. V1 was driven by a 60 year-old male who was not injured.  V1 was towed due to damage.  The critical pre-crash event for the driver of V2 was when another vehicle encroached into her lane from the opposite direction-over the left lane line. The critical reason was not coded to the driver of V2 and no associated factors were coded to her. V2 was driven by a 42 year-old female who was not injured.  V2 was also towed due to damage."

        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.",
        "This crash occurred in the evening hours on the bituminous northbound lanes of a divided urban highway.  The two northbound were dry, level, curved to the right, and featured shoulders on both sides as well as a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50mph).  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was dark but lighted with normal traffic flow.V1, a 2000 Mazda 626, was traveling north in lane one when its left side was contacted by V2, an unknown type van, as it re-entered the roadway from the shoulder. The initial impact caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle and began to swerve off the road to the left.  She drove a few feet up the embankment on the side of the road digging her left side tires into the grass/dirt causing them to blow out and damage her undercarriage.  V1 abruptly steered right descended down the hill and began to rollover. V1 re-entered the roadway still turning clockwise and rolled over two quarter turns onto its top coming to final rest facing south.  V2 continued traveling and didn't stop.V1 was driven a 25-year old female in good health on her way home.  She stated she didn't expect a vehicle (V2) to be traveling on the shoulder.  When she finally saw V2 encroaching from the left shoulder into her lane. Both driver and passenger were transported to the hospital with moderate injuries and V1 was towed due to damages.    "

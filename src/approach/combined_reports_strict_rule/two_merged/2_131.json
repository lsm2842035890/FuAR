        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction and a one-way roadway with one lane of travel.  The roadway was straight and level, and had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device; the southbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. It was dark but lighted, and clear with no adverse conditions.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Lexus SC430 traveling eastbound on the two-way roadway and Vehicle #2 was a 1993 Lexus LS400 traveling south on the one-way roadway.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right side of Vehicle #2.  The front of Vehicle #1 then impacted a light-pole on the southeast corner of the intersection.  The Lexus SC430 (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 45-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  He stated that he was going straight through the intersection when Vehicle #2 ran the stop sign and caused him to impact Vehicle #2 and then into the light-pole.  He stated that he did not perform any avoidance maneuvers.  The Lexus SC430 was towed due to damage.  ",
        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a three-lane T-intersection.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the late afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 45 MPH with a 5% downhill grade and a curve-left.       V1 was a 2004 Jeep Cherokee SUV traveling westbound in the right travel lane approaching the T-intersection intending on turning left.  V2, a 1990 Mitsubishi Galant sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane intending on going straight.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V2 in the eastbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing southbound and V2 came to final rest facing eastbound."

        "     The crash occurred on a two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 48 KPH (30 MPH) and a -2.2% grade.  There was an intersecting driveway to the right with a -13.3% grade.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this early morning weekday crash.     Vehicle 1, a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway approaching the driveway.  It should be noted that there was a large sign, small hill and telephone pole to this driver's right, which may have obscured the approach of Vehicle 2.  Vehicle 2, a 2000 Toyota Corolla, was traveling west on the driveway approaching the main roadway.  Vehicle 2 entered the main roadway and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 was rotated counterclockwise off the left side of the roadway, over a small curb, onto a private lawn and came to rest facing east.  Vehicle 1 continued and came to rest in the southbound lane facing north.     The Chevrolet Blazer (Vehicle 1) was driven by a belted 50-year-old male who was transported, treated and released for a complaint of pain.  Vehicle 1 was traveling north on the roadway and saw Vehicle 2 coming down the driveway off to the right.  He put on his brakes and steered right but hit Vehicle 2 on the left side.  Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight with snow and slush on the roadway at 1:06 pm on a Monday afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 50 MPH and the northbound lane had a positive 3% grade.      V1 was a 1998 Toyota Camry sedan intending on going straight thru the intersection with a green light in the southbound lane.  V2 was a 1994 Dodge Intrepid sedan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a green light.  V2 was in the northbound lane.  As V2 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1.  V1 continued on and the front right corner struck a guardrail, coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading north.      A 34-year-old male who was transported drove V1 and was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.  He stated that he was going straight in the southbound lane and he saw the other vehicle turning in front of him.  He was unable to take any avoidance actions.  V1 continued straight and the front of V1 rested against a guardrail.  The driver of V1 was traveling at 50 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage and had a CDC of 10LYEW1."

        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available.",
        "     This two-vehicle crash occurred mid-morning hours during daylight hours in a rural residential area in a type T intersection. The north/south bound two-lane roadway is straight, level and without traffic control devices.  The west/east bound two-lane roadway is straight and downhill for westbound travel and controlled by a stop sign where it dead-ends with the other roadway. The speed limit for the area is 40 kph (25 mph). with no adverse weather or road conditions present.     Vehicle one (V1) a 1972 Ford Galaxie 4-door sedan driven by a 35 year-old male was traveling westbound approaching the stop sign when the driver discovered the brakes were inoperative.  Vehicle #1 steered to the left slightly before it entered the intersection without stopping.  Vehicle two (V2) a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup driven by a 48 year-old male was traveling northbound when it's front right side plane was contacted by the front bumper V1. V1 came to rest facing west. V2 came to rest in the south bound lane facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.     The pre-event movement for V1 coded going straight, category this vehicle control loss due to disabling vehicle failure (brakes). Critical reason for the critical event vehicle related factor \"brakes failed\"."

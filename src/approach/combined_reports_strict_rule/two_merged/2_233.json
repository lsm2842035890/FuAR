        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a curve right.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph).     V1 was a 1999 Toyota Rav 4 SUV traveling westbound in the right lane negotiating a curve-right.  V2, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee SUV, was traveling eastbound in the right lane negotiating the same curve.  V1 drifted across the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing northbound.     V1 was driven by a 50-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  She stated that she was very upset due to recent news about her mother who was ill.  The driver drank two beers and continued to drive when her vehicle drifted across the centerline and struck V2.   V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact.  The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were daylight in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 40 MPH (64 KMPH).V1 was a 1999 Toyota Camry sedan traveling westbound in the right lane.  V2, a 2002 Ford F150 pickup truck, was traveling eastbound in the right lane.  As V1 was traveling westbound, a dead animal was in the roadway and V1 swerved right to try and avoid it but lost control of the vehicle.  V1 fishtailed for several meters and V1 entered oncoming traffic and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles then spun counter clockwise.  V1 came to final rest off the roadway in a field facing northeast.  V2 struck a curb, went down a -45% embankment, and came to final rest against a tree facing south.V1 was driven by a 21-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he saw the dead animal, swerved right, then lost control of his vehicle and struck V2.  V1 was traveling between 41 and 50 MPH (66 and 80 KMPH) and did not take any avoidance actions before striking V2.  V1 was towed due to damage."

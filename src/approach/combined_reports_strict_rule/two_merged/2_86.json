        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent private driveway.  Conditions were dusk and dry with cloudy skies at 4:38 pm on a weekday late afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "This crash occurred in the evening hours on the bituminous northbound lanes of a divided urban highway.  The two northbound were dry, level, curved to the right, and featured shoulders on both sides as well as a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50mph).  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was dark but lighted with normal traffic flow.V1, a 2000 Mazda 626, was traveling north in lane one when its left side was contacted by V2, an unknown type van, as it re-entered the roadway from the shoulder. The initial impact caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle and began to swerve off the road to the left.  She drove a few feet up the embankment on the side of the road digging her left side tires into the grass/dirt causing them to blow out and damage her undercarriage.  V1 abruptly steered right descended down the hill and began to rollover. V1 re-entered the roadway still turning clockwise and rolled over two quarter turns onto its top coming to final rest facing south.  V2 continued traveling and didn't stop.V1 was driven a 25-year old female in good health on her way home.  She stated she didn't expect a vehicle (V2) to be traveling on the shoulder.  When she finally saw V2 encroaching from the left shoulder into her lane. Both driver and passenger were transported to the hospital with moderate injuries and V1 was towed due to damages.    "

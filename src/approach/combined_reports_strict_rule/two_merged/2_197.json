        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction.  The roadway was straight and level and had a speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).  It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions.Vehicle # 1 was a 1994 Acura Vigor that was traveling eastbound.  Vehicle # 2 was a Lincoln Town Car that attempted to make a left turn into a gas station.  The front of Vehicle # 1 contacted the front of Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 then impacted the right side of Vehicle # 2 before coming to a final rest.The Acura Vigor (Vehicle # 1), was driven by a 47-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver stated that he was going straight when Vehicle # 2 attempted to turn in front of him.  The Acura Vigor was towed due to damage.",
        "V1, a 2000 Pontiac Montana minivan, made a left turn from a private driveway onto a northbound 5-lane two-way, dry asphalt roadway on a downhill grade.  The posted speed limit on this roadway was 80 kmph (50 MPH). V1 entered the roadway by crossing over the two southbound lanes and then entering the third northbound lane, which was a left turn-only lane at a 4-way intersection. The driver of V1 intended to travel straight through the intersection, and so he began to change lanes to the right. He did not see V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, that was traveling in the second northbound lane. The northbound roadway had curved to the right prior to the private driveway that V1 had exited. As V1 began to change lanes to the right, the front of V1 contacted the left rear of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway.The driver of V1 was a 60-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-17 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling back home.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He did not sustain any injuries from the crash and refused treatment.The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he began to travel over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). Associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include an illegal use of a left turn lane (cited by police) and an unfamiliarity with the roadway. As per the driver of V1, this was the first time he had driven on this roadway.  "

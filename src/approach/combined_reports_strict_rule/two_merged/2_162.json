        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the evening hours in the middle of the two northbound lanes of a physically divided (concrete barrier) bridge.  There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, although it was dark and no streetlights were present.  The roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of the roadway was 72kph (45mph).  V1, a 2005 Mazda 626, was northbound in lane one on the bridge.  V2, a 1995 Ford Windstar, was disabled on the bridge in lane one ahead of vehicle one.  V1 failed to stop and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2 the impact pushed V2 forward and its right side contacted the right concrete barrier before coming to final rest.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to vehicle damage.V1 was driven by a 22 year-old female who suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision, but did not require transport to a medical facility.  After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of vehicle one.  From statements given to the police on scene the driver of V1 had consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the crash but sobriety tests confirmed she was still within the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  Conditions were daylight with rain in the morning on a weekday.  Both lanes had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).       V1 was a 2003 Kia Rio sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching the intersection with a blinking beacon light.  V2, a 2002 Honda Civic sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection.  V1 made a left turn in front of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  The two vehicles then side-slapped the front right bumper of V1 hit the right rear wheel rim of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing west.  V2 came to final rest facing northeast.      V1 was driven by a 44-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she thought that V2 was turning so she made a left turn in front of V2.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

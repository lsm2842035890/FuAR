        "      The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an intersection controlled by a traffic control.  Conditions were cloudy and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph).     V1 was a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV traveling in the first travel lane approaching the intersection controlled by a traffic signal intending on going straight.  V2, a 2000 Sterling A9500 M/H truck, was stopped at the intersection with a red traffic control signal.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 69-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital.  The driver of V1 refused to be interviewed.  V1 was towed due to damage.  ",
        "This 2-vehicle crash occurred in the evening at a T-intersection in a suburban neighborhood. A 2-lane roadway runs east and west with an intersecting road that runs north and south. Both roadways have a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) and each are controlled by a stop sign at the intersection where the crash took place. The conditions were dusk, clear, dry and the traffic level was moderate. V1, a 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo 4 x4 with one occupant, was traveling east in lane one of 2-lane undivided road approaching an intersecting road to its right. V2, a 1997 Honda CR-V with one occupant, was stopped (facing north) at the intersection waiting to turn left (westbound.) Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and collided at a right angle. The front of the Honda CR-V (V2) struck the right side of the Jeep Cherokee (V1) causing it to roll 2-quarter turns to its left and coming to rest on its roof. V1 had to be towed from the scene due to damage but V2 was driven away.V1 was driven by a 25-year-old female without a driver license. She did not speak English but her bilingual boyfriend/husband did speak English and he refused to help with the interview. The investigating officer said she was not cooperative with him or the EMS either, but she reportedly claimed the brakes failed. Once the vehicle was rolled back onto its tires, it was towed to the owner's house without the brakes ever being checked.  "

        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one-lane in each direction and a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  It was daylight and the conditions were clear with no adverse conditions.  The roadway was level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 1 was a 1999 Dodge Caravan, which was traveling northbound on the two-way roadway with one lane in each direction.  As he crossed the intersection he was contacted on the right side by the front of Vehicle # 2.The Dodge Caravan (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 66-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver declined to participate in the study, but a witness stated that he stopped for the light, and then proceeded through the intersection while he had the red light.  The minivan was towed due to damage.",
        "V1, a 2000 Pontiac Montana minivan, made a left turn from a private driveway onto a northbound 5-lane two-way, dry asphalt roadway on a downhill grade.  The posted speed limit on this roadway was 80 kmph (50 MPH). V1 entered the roadway by crossing over the two southbound lanes and then entering the third northbound lane, which was a left turn-only lane at a 4-way intersection. The driver of V1 intended to travel straight through the intersection, and so he began to change lanes to the right. He did not see V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, that was traveling in the second northbound lane. The northbound roadway had curved to the right prior to the private driveway that V1 had exited. As V1 began to change lanes to the right, the front of V1 contacted the left rear of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway.The driver of V1 was a 60-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-17 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling back home.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He did not sustain any injuries from the crash and refused treatment.The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he began to travel over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). Associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include an illegal use of a left turn lane (cited by police) and an unfamiliarity with the roadway. As per the driver of V1, this was the first time he had driven on this roadway.  "

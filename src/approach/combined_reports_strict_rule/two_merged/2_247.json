        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane intersection controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the morning on a weekday.  The eastbound lane had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) with a stop sign; the southbound lane had a speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).V1 was 1999 Pontiac Montana Minivan, which was traveling southbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 1991 Ford Tempo sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching the intersection with a stop sign.  V2 stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded through the intersection.  V1's front struck the left side of V2 in the eastbound lane.  V1 came to final rest facing eastbound and V2 came to final rest facing northbound.V1 was driven by a 40-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she was going straight, saw V2 stopped at the sign, and then saw V2 accelerate into her path.  The driver of V1 didn't understand why V2 decided to accelerate.  The driver of V1 braked but could not successfully avoid V2.  V1 was traveling between 17-32 kmph (11-20 mph) at the time of impact.  V1 was driven from the scene.  The driver of V1 did not want me to take any pictures of the vehicle.",
        "This crash occurred on the southbound lanes of a five-lane undivided urban highway. There were three southbound lanes that included a left turn lane for the traffic signal-controlled intersection. Conditions were dark, but the roadway was illuminated and dry in the mid-evening hours on a weekend. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 48 KMPH (30 MPH) and the southbound lanes were straight and level. The crash occurred on a weekend during the hours of darkness.Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Hyundai Accent 2-door hatchback driven by a 65-year old female. She was traveling in the first lane of travel, approaching a four-way intersection controlled by a traffic signal. V2, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder was stopped for a red light in the same lane at the intersection ahead of V1. The driver of V1 stated that she looked to her left at a retail store while braking, thinking that V2 was quite a distance ahead of her. She estimated that she had enough room between her vehicle and Vehicle #2 as she slowed down to the intersection. She stated she probably didn't apply enough braking force, and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 was wearing her lap and shoulder seatbelt.  The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when another vehicle was in her lane stopped at the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an external distraction. This was chosen because the operator of V1 stated that she was looking at a store to her left as she approached the rear of V2. She also stated that she thought that V2 was farther ahead of her than it actually was. Because of this, she was also coded as misjudging the gap distance to V2. Another associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate evasive action. By her own admission, she did not apply sufficient pressure to her brake pedal. The driver of V1 reported that she was taking four medications:  an unknown diabetes medication, a cholesterol-lowering medication, an anti-inflammatory, and an antidepressant. Only the antidepressant had the possible side effects of dizziness and tiredness. She did not wear glasses for driving. She stated she was two-third's deaf in both ears but could not afford hearing aids although her driving license had a restriction on it indicating that she should be wearing hearing aids. She was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway. Police did not consider alcohol to be involved and ordered no tests."

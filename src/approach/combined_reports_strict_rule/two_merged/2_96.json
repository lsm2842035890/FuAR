        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent private driveway.  Conditions were dusk and dry with cloudy skies at 4:38 pm on a weekday late afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "V1, a 2000 Pontiac Montana minivan, made a left turn from a private driveway onto a northbound 5-lane two-way, dry asphalt roadway on a downhill grade.  The posted speed limit on this roadway was 80 kmph (50 MPH). V1 entered the roadway by crossing over the two southbound lanes and then entering the third northbound lane, which was a left turn-only lane at a 4-way intersection. The driver of V1 intended to travel straight through the intersection, and so he began to change lanes to the right. He did not see V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, that was traveling in the second northbound lane. The northbound roadway had curved to the right prior to the private driveway that V1 had exited. As V1 began to change lanes to the right, the front of V1 contacted the left rear of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway.The driver of V1 was a 60-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-17 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling back home.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He did not sustain any injuries from the crash and refused treatment.The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he began to travel over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). Associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include an illegal use of a left turn lane (cited by police) and an unfamiliarity with the roadway. As per the driver of V1, this was the first time he had driven on this roadway.  "

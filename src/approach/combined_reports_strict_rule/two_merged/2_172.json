        "This crash occurred on a two lane undivided roadway, slightly curving to the right prior to the crash site, with no grade and a posted speed limit of  72 KMPH (45 MPH). The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.Vehicle #1, a 1998 Honda Accord, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway when it stopped to allow several  southbound vehicles  to pass before proceeding to make an intended left turn onto a side road. Vehicle #2, a 1994 Ford Escort LX, was traveling in the same direction behind Vehicle #1. Vehicle #2 impacted the rear of Vehicle #1 with it's front. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway facing north.The Honda Accord (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted  37 year old female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released, with a complaint of pain to her neck.  She stated that she was stopped, waiting for the on coming traffic to clear before she made her left turn.  Just as she glanced at her rear view mirror she saw Vehicle #2 coming at her fast.  The driver of Vehicle #2 was not slowing down and then she heard brakes and she gripped the steering wheel, and then she was hit from behind.  The driver of this vehicle was wearing prescription contacts at the time of the crash.  Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene.",
        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight, dry in the early afternoon on a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 81 KPH (50 MPH) and the northbound lane had a positive 3% grade. V2 was a 1992 Ford Escort coupe intending on going straight through the intersection with a green light in the southbound lane.  V1 was a 1999 Chevy Venture minivan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a red light.  V1 was in the northbound lane.  As V1 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  As a result of the impact, V1 rolled \u00bc turn onto its left side coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading southwest. A 33-year-old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but was not transported.    He stated that the light was red as he was turning left.  He saw V2 but thought he was going to stop. After V2 hit V1 the vehicle rolled \u00bc turn on its left side.  V1 was traveling less than 8 KPH (5 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

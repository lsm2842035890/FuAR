This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.Vehicle #1, a 1998 Honda Accord, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway when it stopped to allow several  southbound vehicles  to pass before proceeding to make an intended left turn onto a side road. Vehicle #2, a 1994 Ford Escort LX, was traveling in the same direction behind Vehicle #1. Vehicle #2 impacted the rear of Vehicle #1 with it's front. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway facing north.The Honda Accord (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted  37 year old female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released, with a complaint of pain to her neck.  She stated that she was stopped, waiting for the on coming traffic to clear before she made her left turn.  Just as she glanced at her rear view mirror she saw Vehicle #2 coming at her fast.  The driver of Vehicle #2 was not slowing down and then she heard brakes and she gripped the steering wheel, and then she was hit from behind.

V2 was a 1994 Dodge Intrepid sedan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a green light.  V2 was in the northbound lane.  As V2 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1.  V1 continued on and the front right corner struck a guardrail, coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading north.      A 34-year-old male who was transported drove V1 and was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.

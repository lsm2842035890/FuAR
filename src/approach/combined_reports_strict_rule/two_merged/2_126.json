        "     The crash occurred on a two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 48 KPH (30 MPH) and a -2.2% grade.  There was an intersecting driveway to the right with a -13.3% grade.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this early morning weekday crash.     Vehicle 1, a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling north on the two lane undivided roadway approaching the driveway.  It should be noted that there was a large sign, small hill and telephone pole to this driver's right, which may have obscured the approach of Vehicle 2.  Vehicle 2, a 2000 Toyota Corolla, was traveling west on the driveway approaching the main roadway.  Vehicle 2 entered the main roadway and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 was rotated counterclockwise off the left side of the roadway, over a small curb, onto a private lawn and came to rest facing east.  Vehicle 1 continued and came to rest in the southbound lane facing north.     The Chevrolet Blazer (Vehicle 1) was driven by a belted 50-year-old male who was transported, treated and released for a complaint of pain.  Vehicle 1 was traveling north on the roadway and saw Vehicle 2 coming down the driveway off to the right.  He put on his brakes and steered right but hit Vehicle 2 on the left side.  Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.",
        "\tThe crash occurred at a T-intersection of an eastbound 5-lane undivided roadway and a northbound driveway exit from a parking lot.  The eastbound roadway was a two-way, five-lane roadway with a two-way left turn lane in the middle.  Both the eastbound roadway and the driveway were straight, level, bituminous roadways.   The posted speed for east/west traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph).  Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies.  Traffic flow in the eastbound direction was backed up for a light at a signalized intersection up ahead.    \tV1, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was stopped at a stop sign at the parking lot exit, waiting to turn left.  V2, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in the two-way left turn lane.  Traffic in the first two eastbound lanes was backed up for a traffic light ahead.  Vehicles in those lanes made space for V1 to pull out.  As V1 pulled out to turn left, the front of V1 made contact with the front of V2 in the third (middle) lane of travel.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.   \tV1 was driven by a 23-year old female who sustained possible injuries.  She was transported to the hospital from the crash scene by her boyfriend.  She stated that she had stopped at the drug store on her way to the hospice to see her grandmother.  Eastbound traffic was backed up, but the first two lanes left a gap for her to exit.  She said that one of the drivers waved her out.  She stated that she didn't see anything, so she cautiously pulled out.  The driver indicated that she did not know where the other vehicle came from.    "

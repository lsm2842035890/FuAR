        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a five-lane roadway.  Conditions were dry with sun glare in the early morning on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 45 MPH.     V1 was a 2001 Nissan Altman sedan traveling eastbound in the 1st travel lane intending on going straight.  V2, a 1994 Honda Accord station wagon, was stopped in traffic in the eastbound lane directly in front of V1.  The front of V1 struck the back of V2 in the eastbound lane.  Both vehicles came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 17-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries but refused medical attention.  He stated that he was on his way to school and had some fog on his windshield and there was real bad sun glare.  The driver of V1 also stated that he never saw V2.  V1 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 41-50 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage.",

        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a two-way roadway with one-lane in each direction and a two-way roadway with two lanes in each direction.  It was daylight and the conditions were clear with no adverse conditions.  The roadway was level and had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph).Vehicle # 1 was a 1999 Dodge Caravan, which was traveling northbound on the two-way roadway with one lane in each direction.  As he crossed the intersection he was contacted on the right side by the front of Vehicle # 2.The Dodge Caravan (Vehicle # 1) was driven by a 66-year old male who did not sustain any injuries.  The driver declined to participate in the study, but a witness stated that he stopped for the light, and then proceeded through the intersection while he had the red light.  The minivan was towed due to damage.",
        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane roadway separated by a raised curb median (two lanes each direction) at an intersection controlled by a traffic signal.  Conditions were daylight with clouds in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 MPH).  The westbound lanes had a negative 2 percent slope.     V1 was a 2004 Chevy Cavalier sedan traveling around a jug-handle intending to turn left at the intersection with the east/west roadway.  V2, a 2002 Buick Century sedan, was traveling westbound in the left lane intending on continuing straight through the intersection with a green traffic control signal.  The driver of V1 stated that she stopped for a red traffic signal, and when she thought that her light had changed to green, she entered the intersection. The front of V1 struck the right front side of V2.  V2 was deflected to the left and onto the grass median where the front of V2 struck a traffic control signal post.  V1 came to final rest facing southeast and V2 came to final rest facing southwest.  A witness that was identified on the police report as traveling to the right of and behind V2 indicated that the traffic signal for westbound traffic had been green. The county's highway department reviewed the tripped curcuit and verified that traffic on the jug-handle (V1) had a red light.     A 41-year old female drove V1 and was not injured.  She stated that she was traveling around the jug-handle intending on turning left at the intersection with a possible green traffic control signal when V2 struck the front of her vehicle.  The driver of V1 did not have time to take any avoidance actions.  V1 was traveling between 11-20 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

The roadway surface asphalt and was snow and ice covered at the time of the crash.  This portion of the roadway is a T intersection.  The east/west roadway intersects with the north end of a two lane two-way roadway (which ends at the T intersection with a stop sign).  A double yellow solid lane line divides the east/west roadway.  A double yellow solid lane line also divides the north/south roadway.  The eastbound lane has a 7% positive grade.  The northbound lane has a 2% negative grade.

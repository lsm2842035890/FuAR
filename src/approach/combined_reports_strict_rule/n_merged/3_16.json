        "     The crash occurred in the middle of the intersection of a two-lane roadway.  Conditions were dark with lights and dry in the evening on a weekday.  The posted speed limit for both roads was 40 kmph (25 mph).     V1 was a 2005 Toyota Matrix hatchback traveling westbound in the right lane approaching an intersection.  V2, a 2005 Hyundai Accent coupe, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection with a stop sign.  V2 did not stop at the stop sign and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the intersection.  V1 then rolled 6-quarter rolls and came to final rest on its roof facing eastbound.  V2 came to final rest facing northwest.     V1 was driven by a 31-year-old male who was transported with moderate injuries to a local hospital prior to our arrival.  V1 was towed due to damage.  The driver stated that he was traveling through the intersection and the other car just drover through the stop sign, she didn't even slow down.  Driver of V1 gave a partial interview in the ambulance, but would not respond to numerous attempts to contact him via both landline and cell phone.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a T intersection.  The northbound lane was a one-way roadway, which intersected the two-way, two-lane east/west roadway.  A stop sign was present for the one-way traffic, however there were no signs or signals present for the east/west roadway.  The incident occurred in the early morning hours, and it was raining at the time of the crash.  Both roadways were considered to be level, and both roadways had a posted speed limit of 40kph (25mph).  Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Suzuki XL-7, was traveling north on the one-way roadway approaching the intersection.  Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Nissan Maxima, was traveling west on the two-way roadway also approaching the intersection.  The front of V2 made contact with the left front of V1.  Both vehicles came to final rest shortly after the impact.  Vehicle one was driven from the scene, however, vehicle two had to be towed due to vehicle damage.  The driver of V1, a 40-year old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention.   An interview could not be obtained from the driver because the telephone number on the Police Accident Report (PAR) was for a fax machine.  No record of the driver could be found in the phone book or on the Internet.  Through information contained in the PAR, it was revealed that the driver of V1 was not familiar with the area.  Further, he believed that the crossing roadway was also a one-way roadway and that V2 had a stop sign as well.  ",
        "     The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection.  The northbound travel lane was controlled by a stop sign.  Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The posted speed limit was 35 MPH and both roads were level.     V1 was a 2002 Mazda 323 hatchback traveling northbound in the right lane approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign intending on going straight.  V2, a 1997 Nissan Maxima sedan, was traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching the intersection intending on going straight.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing northeast.  V2 came to final rest facing eastbound.     V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male who was not injured.  He stated that he was stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions, then proceeded thru the intersection but saw V2 in the corner of his eye.  The driver of V1 braked and swerved right but was unable to avoid contact with V2.  V1 was traveling between 1 and 10 MPH at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

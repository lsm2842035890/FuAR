The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.",

There were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.  Vehicle one (V1) was exiting a parking lot, which had a gradient of +2.  Vehicle two (V2) was going straight on a level roadway, passing the parking lot from where V1 was exiting.  There were no traffic control devices present at the location of this crash.

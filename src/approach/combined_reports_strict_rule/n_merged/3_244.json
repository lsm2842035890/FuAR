        "\tThe crash occurred at a T-intersection of an eastbound 5-lane undivided roadway and a northbound driveway exit from a parking lot.  The eastbound roadway was a two-way, five-lane roadway with a two-way left turn lane in the middle.  Both the eastbound roadway and the driveway were straight, level, bituminous roadways.   The posted speed for east/west traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph).  Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies.  Traffic flow in the eastbound direction was backed up for a light at a signalized intersection up ahead.    \tV1, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was stopped at a stop sign at the parking lot exit, waiting to turn left.  V2, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in the two-way left turn lane.  Traffic in the first two eastbound lanes was backed up for a traffic light ahead.  Vehicles in those lanes made space for V1 to pull out.  As V1 pulled out to turn left, the front of V1 made contact with the front of V2 in the third (middle) lane of travel.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.   \tV1 was driven by a 23-year old female who sustained possible injuries.  She was transported to the hospital from the crash scene by her boyfriend.  She stated that she had stopped at the drug store on her way to the hospice to see her grandmother.  Eastbound traffic was backed up, but the first two lanes left a gap for her to exit.  She said that one of the drivers waved her out.  She stated that she didn't see anything, so she cautiously pulled out.  The driver indicated that she did not know where the other vehicle came from.    ",
        "\tThe crash occurred in a T-intersection of a five-lane two-way roadway and a three-lane two-way roadway.  The five-lane roadway had two lanes eastbound and two lanes westbound with a center two-way left turn lane. The three-lane roadway had two lanes northbound and one lane southbound. The northbound lanes ended at the intersection and were curved to the left. Northbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign. East and westbound traffic had no traffic control device. The posted speed limit on the east/west roadway was 64 kmph (40 mph).  The crash occurred in the early hours of the afternoon on a sunny day. All roadways were dry.  \tV1, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling northbound attempting to turn left into the westbound lanes of traffic.  V2, a 1984 Yamaha motorcycle, was traveling in the second eastbound lane, approaching the intersection.  A witness who was traveling next to V2 in the first lane of travel reported that V1 rolled through the stop sign and pulled out into the path of V2 and herself. Although the witness was able to stop in time, the driver of the motorcycle was not. The driver of V1 told police that he was trying to make a light located at a nearby interstate, and never saw V2 approaching. V1 pulled out from the intersection and was struck in the left side by the front of V2.\tV1 was driven by a 30-year old male. He was transported to a local medical facility for treatment and was subsequently released. The driver of V2, a 52-year old male, was transported and admitted to a local hospital due to major injuries.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.",
        "The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane roadway with a traffic control signal.  Conditions were daylight, dry in the early afternoon on a weekday.  The roadway had a posted speed of 81 KPH (50 MPH) and the northbound lane had a positive 3% grade. V2 was a 1992 Ford Escort coupe intending on going straight through the intersection with a green light in the southbound lane.  V1 was a 1999 Chevy Venture minivan intending on turning left at the same intersection with a red light.  V1 was in the northbound lane.  As V1 was turning left, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1.  As a result of the impact, V1 rolled \u00bc turn onto its left side coming to final rest.  V2 came to final rest in the center of the intersection-heading southwest. A 33-year-old male drove V1 and sustained minor injuries but was not transported.    He stated that the light was red as he was turning left.  He saw V2 but thought he was going to stop. After V2 hit V1 the vehicle rolled \u00bc turn on its left side.  V1 was traveling less than 8 KPH (5 MPH) at the time of impact.  V1 was towed due to damage."

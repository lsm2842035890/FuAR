        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent private driveway.  Conditions were dusk and dry with cloudy skies at 4:38 pm on a weekday late afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "\tV1, a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling eastbound on a 4-lane, 2-way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions.  V1 was traveling in lane one intending to turn right at a T-intersection.  V2, a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan, was stopped for a red light in lane one in front of V1 on the same roadway, also intending to turn right. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The front of V1 contacted the back of V2.  Both vehicles came to final rest off the south road edge.\tThe driver of V1 was a 21-year old male who had reported that he had been traveling between 18-32 kmph (11-20mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling to a restaurant.  He does not wear corrective lenses.  He was uninjured and refused treatment.\tThe Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.  The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a recognition error, an external distraction, because he stated that he was looking at approaching traffic to his left and did not realize that the vehicle ahead of him had stopped."

        "\tThis crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry.  It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west.  V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs).  V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind.  For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.               The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was coded as: \"Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped.\"  The Critical Reason was coded as \"Type of driver error unknown,\" due to the lack of an interview. An associated factor was alcohol use - the police report indicates that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash and was taken from the scene for alcohol testing. The results of that testing were not made available.",
        "This crash occurred in the intersection of a north/south road with one lane in each direction and an east/west road with one lane in each direction.  The roadways were straight and level and each had a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was raining and the roadways were wet.  The crash occurred in the morning hours on a weekend.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina that was traveling southbound. Vehicle #2 was a 2003 Lexus LS430 that was traveling westbound.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #2 impacted the left side of Vehicle #1.  The impact spun Vehicle #1 counter-clockwise and the right side impacted a train support pillar.  Vehicle #1 then spun clockwise to its final rest, facing northbound.The Chevrolet Lumina (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 52-year old male who did not sustain any injuries. A 52-year old female occupant in the front-right seat sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local medical facility.  The driver stated that he was going straight and had the green light when Vehicle #2 ran the red light, which caused him to impact the train support pillar.  The Chevrolet Lumina was towed due to damage.",

Both vehicles were towed due to damage.The driver of V1, a seventeen-year old female was heading from her aunts home back to her house.

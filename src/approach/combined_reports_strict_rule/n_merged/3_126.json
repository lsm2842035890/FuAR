Vehicle # 1 was a Lincoln Navigator that was traveling northbound behind Vehicle # 2.  The front of Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2.  Vehicle # 2 then continued forward and impacted a fence that was located on the northwest corner.

        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.",
        "This two-vehicle crash occurred in the evening hours in the middle of the two northbound lanes of a physically divided (concrete barrier) bridge.

The roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of the roadway was 72kph (45mph).  V1, a 2005 Mazda 626, was northbound in lane one on the bridge.  V2, a 1995 Ford Windstar, was disabled on the bridge in lane one ahead of vehicle one.  V1 failed to stop and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2 the impact pushed V2 forward and its right side contacted the right concrete barrier before coming to final rest.  Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to vehicle damage.V1 was driven by a 22 year-old female who suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision, but did not require transport to a medical facility.  After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of vehicle one.  From statements given to the police on scene the driver of V1 had consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the crash but sobriety tests confirmed she was still within the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle.  V1 was towed due to damage."

        "     The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection.  Conditions were dusk and dry in the evening on a weekend.  The northbound lane had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and the eastbound lane had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).     V1 was a 2003 Hyundai Elantra sedan traveling eastbound in the right lane approaching a T-intersection.  V2, a 1998 Ford Taurus sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left.  V2 stopped at the stop sign, looked in both directions but there was landscaping and a fence obstructing V2's view.  V2 then proceeded to turn left and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in the intersection., as V1 passed by V2, V2's right front contacted the back of V1.  V1 continued on and struck a curb and a tree.  V1 came to final rest facing eastbound.  V2 continued on and struck a curb and came to final rest facing northwest.",
        "\tThe crash occurred at a three-legged intersection in the eastbound lane of a two-lane suburban roadway.  The northbound road approaching the intersection was controlled by a stop sign and had a 4% downhill grade.  The eastbound road curved left at the intersection and had a 3% downhill grade.  The roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), though the crash occurred during a 40 kmph (25 mph) school zone time.  Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies.  The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours of a weekday.  \tVehicle one was a 1991 Acura Integra 3-door hatchback traveling east in lane one.  Vehicle two was a 2000 Honda Civic coupe stopped facing north.  V1 continued through the intersection while V2 proceeded to attempt a left turn.  The two vehicles struck head on.  Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection.  \tV1 was driven by an 18-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with possible injuries.  She stated that it appeared V2 was trying to follow a friend driving in front of V2 who had just completed a left turn in front of this driver.  V2 tried to pull out quickly in front of this driver but mistimed her maneuver.  This driver estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 40 kmph (25 mph), saying she didn't have a chance to slow down.  V1 was towed due to damage. ",

        "The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway with an adjacent private driveway.  Conditions were dusk and dry with cloudy skies at 4:38 pm on a weekday late afternoon.  The roadway had a posted speed of 35 MPH and the eastbound lane had a negative 2% grade.  The private driveway was dry and did not have a posted speed limit but had a negative 3% grade.Vehicle 1 was a 1995 Plymouth Neon Sedan decelerating for the vehicle in front of him, which was making a left turn into a plaza.  Vehicle 2, a 1996 Kia Sephia, was exiting a private drive to the right of Vehicle 1.  The front of V1 struck the right side of V2; V2 rotated 90 degrees right.  V1 swerved right then left then both vehicles came to final rest in the right lane facing east.The 45-year-old driver of the Plymouth Neon (V1) stated that he was struck on the right side and swerved to final rest in the eastbound lane.  The driver of V1 sustained a laceration to his forehead and was transported to the emergency room.  V1 was towed due to damage.",
        "\tThis motor vehicle crash took place on a two-lane roadway.  This roadway has a set of rail tracks dividing the two lanes.  The roadway runs north/south with one lane in each direction and the posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).  The north/south roadway was not controlled by any TCD's (traffic control devices).\tV1, a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport Utility Vehicle, was traveling northbound in lane one.  V2, a 2001 Hyundai Sonata, came out of a parking lot onto northbound lane one, attempting to turn right.  V1 was unable to stop and ended up striking the left side of V2 with its front end.  Both vehicles came to rest.\tNo interview was obtained from the driver of V1, a 26-year old female. According to an eyewitness account, V1 was traveling at about 30mph. V2 pulled out of the lot carelessly, not looking in either direction nor making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. The eyewitness was in a vehicle traveling behind V1 at time of the crash.",
        "This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes (two lanes head east and one heads west) of a three lane undivided, straight roadway in an urban-like setting where the posted speed limit is 48kmph (30mph).  The roadway was dry and the weather was clear. This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.V1, a 1991 Chrysler New Yorker, was traveling east when it stopped in lane two (the left turn lane) awaiting traffic to pass before turning into a fast food restaurant.  V2, a 1990 Nissan Pick-up, truck was leaving a service station on the east side of the road.V2 was waived out of the lot by the driver of an uninvolved vehicle stopped in lane one of the roadway.  As V2 proceeded out of the lot it was struck by the front left of V1.  The driver and a passenger of V1 were transported to an area hospital, treated and released. Another passenger in V1 was not injured. The driver of V2 was not injured.",
        "V1, a 2000 Pontiac Montana minivan, made a left turn from a private driveway onto a northbound 5-lane two-way, dry asphalt roadway on a downhill grade.  The posted speed limit on this roadway was 80 kmph (50 MPH). V1 entered the roadway by crossing over the two southbound lanes and then entering the third northbound lane, which was a left turn-only lane at a 4-way intersection. The driver of V1 intended to travel straight through the intersection, and so he began to change lanes to the right. He did not see V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, that was traveling in the second northbound lane. The northbound roadway had curved to the right prior to the private driveway that V1 had exited. As V1 began to change lanes to the right, the front of V1 contacted the left rear of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway.The driver of V1 was a 60-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-17 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash.  He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash.  He was rested and traveling back home.  He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition.  He did not sustain any injuries from the crash and refused treatment.The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was when he began to travel over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). Associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include an illegal use of a left turn lane (cited by police) and an unfamiliarity with the roadway. As per the driver of V1, this was the first time he had driven on this roadway.  "

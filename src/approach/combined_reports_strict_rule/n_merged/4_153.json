        "\tThe crash occurred in the early evening hours while still daylight at a T-intersection.  The main street was an east/west two-lane two-way roadway with no traffic control. The posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). The crossing street ran north/south and ended at the T-intersection.  The north/south roadway was a two-lane two-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The east west roadway had a shoulder on either side, which diminished as it neared the intersection.  The roadway was divided by two solid yellow lines.  There were no adverse weather conditions that day and both roadways were dry.   \tV1, a 1998 Ford Taurus station wagon, was driven by a 20-year old female. V1 was traveling west on the east/west roadway. V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 24-year old female. V2 was traveling south on the north/south roadway. According to police and witness reports, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop at her stop sign, facing south.  The driver of V2 then entered the intersection and attempted to turn left to travel east on the east/west roadway.  As V2 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front right of V1. The momentum of V1 pushed V2 off of the roadway and down the east/west roadway traveling westbound, coming to rest approximately 51.6m from impact in the eastbound lanes.  V1 rolled off of the sidewalk and came to rest facing south in the middle of the two east/west lanes.\tThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as \"other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.\" The Critical Reason For the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to V1, although excess speed was coded as an associated factor. A witness who had been traveling behind V1 reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to impact. The extent of damage to V2 and the post-impact trajectory of the vehicles supported the claim of excess speed, as the posted speed limit was 40 KMPH (25 MPH). All other information was unknown due to the lack of an interview with the driver of V1.",
        "This crash occurred in the intersection of a north/south road with one lane in each direction and an east/west road with one lane in each direction.  The roadways were straight and level and each had a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).  It was raining and the roadways were wet.  The crash occurred in the morning hours on a weekend.Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina that was traveling southbound. Vehicle #2 was a 2003 Lexus LS430 that was traveling westbound.  At the intersection, the front of Vehicle #2 impacted the left side of Vehicle #1.  The impact spun Vehicle #1 counter-clockwise and the right side impacted a train support pillar.  Vehicle #1 then spun clockwise to its final rest, facing northbound.The Chevrolet Lumina (Vehicle #1) was driven by a 52-year old male who did not sustain any injuries. A 52-year old female occupant in the front-right seat sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local medical facility.  The driver stated that he was going straight and had the green light when Vehicle #2 ran the red light, which caused him to impact the train support pillar.  The Chevrolet Lumina was towed due to damage.",
        "    The crash occurred at the T-intersection of an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road and a north/south two-lane local road.  The arterial curves to the south (left) as it approaches the intersection from the east with a radius of curvature of 375m.  Traffic counts indicate it carries 9,036 vehicles per day with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).  The local road is straight and is controlled by a stop sign with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph).  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.    Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with four horses westbound on the two lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound on the local road.  Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn to go east when its left side was struck by the front of Vehicle #1.   After impact the F-250 (V1) rotated counterclockwise and jackknifed with the truck coming to rest partially off the south side of the intersection facing southeast.  The trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest.  The Corolla (V2) rotated clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not injured in the crash.    She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection.  However, she didn't believe the Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance.  Once she realized Vehicle #2 was beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision.  ",

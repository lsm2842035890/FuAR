        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane T-intersection.  Conditions were cloudy and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The westbound road had a posted speed limit of 50 MPH and the southbound road had a posted speed limit of 25 MPH and was controlled by a stop sign.     V1 was a 1985 Chevy Celebrity sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left at the T-intersection.  V2, a 1995 Dodge Neon sedan, was traveling westbound in the right lane intending on continuing straight.  An unknown vehicle was traveling westbound on the same roadway and turned right onto the road where V1 originally was.  V1 then turned left and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles then side-slapped left to right and came to final rest facing southwest.  ",

V2, a 2002 Honda Civic sedan, was traveling northbound in the right lane approaching the same intersection.  V1 made a left turn in front of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in the middle of the intersection.  The two vehicles then side-slapped the front right bumper of V1 hit the right rear wheel rim of V2.  V1 came to final rest facing west.  V2 came to final rest facing northeast.      V1 was driven by a 44-year-old female who was not injured.  She stated that she thought that V2 was turning so she made a left turn in front of V2.  The front of V2 struck the right side of V1.

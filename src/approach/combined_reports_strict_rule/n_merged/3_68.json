Upon realization of the impending crash, the driver of V2 stated that he could not do anything.  V1 was a 2002 Dodge Neon, traveling northbound.  V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper.  The impact caused V1 to push V2 up the roadway.  V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway.  V1 was towed due to damage.  V2 was able to be driven from the scene.I spoke to the construction worker on scene, which was holding the stop sign.  He was only able to give a few words, due to the language barrier.  He attested that V2 was waiting for the sign to change, so V2 could proceed.  He further stated that V1 pushed V2 up the roadway some.",

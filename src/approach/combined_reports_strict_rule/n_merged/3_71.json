        "This crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane roadway. It was not physically divided, and had a traffic-control device, for a construction zone.  The conditions were as follows: early afternoon, clear skies, the roadway was dry and there were no atmospheric conditions.  The gradient for the two vehicles involved were both on a +6% roadway.  The posted speed limit for vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) was 64 kph (40 mph). V2 was a 2005 Mercury Sable was traveling northbound and was stopped for a stop/slow sign for the construction zone.  Upon realization of the impending crash, the driver of V2 stated that he could not do anything.  V1 was a 2002 Dodge Neon, traveling northbound.  V1 struck V2 in the center part of V2's rear bumper.  The impact caused V1 to push V2 up the roadway.  V1 and V2 came to final rest in the roadway.  V1 was towed due to damage.  V2 was able to be driven from the scene.I spoke to the construction worker on scene, which was holding the stop sign.  He was only able to give a few words, due to the language barrier.  He attested that V2 was waiting for the sign to change, so V2 could proceed.  He further stated that V1 pushed V2 up the roadway some.",
        "\tThe crash occurred in a T-intersection of a five-lane two-way roadway and a three-lane two-way roadway.  The five-lane roadway had two lanes eastbound and two lanes westbound with a center two-way left turn lane. The three-lane roadway had two lanes northbound and one lane southbound. The northbound lanes ended at the intersection and were curved to the left. Northbound traffic was controlled by a stop sign. East and westbound traffic had no traffic control device. The posted speed limit on the east/west roadway was 64 kmph (40 mph).  The crash occurred in the early hours of the afternoon on a sunny day. All roadways were dry.  \tV1, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling northbound attempting to turn left into the westbound lanes of traffic.  V2, a 1984 Yamaha motorcycle, was traveling in the second eastbound lane, approaching the intersection.  A witness who was traveling next to V2 in the first lane of travel reported that V1 rolled through the stop sign and pulled out into the path of V2 and herself. Although the witness was able to stop in time, the driver of the motorcycle was not. The driver of V1 told police that he was trying to make a light located at a nearby interstate, and never saw V2 approaching. V1 pulled out from the intersection and was struck in the left side by the front of V2.\tV1 was driven by a 30-year old male. He was transported to a local medical facility for treatment and was subsequently released. The driver of V2, a 52-year old male, was transported and admitted to a local hospital due to major injuries.  Both vehicles were towed due to damage.",

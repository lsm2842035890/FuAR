Construction grading was underway on the south side of the road, the arterial was being widened to four lanes and straightened.  At the time of the crash no workers were present only materials that had been at the site for several months.  There are no construction warning signs since traffic is not affected by the roadwork.  Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.    Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Focus traveling east on the two-lane arterial road.  Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, was westbound on the same road.   Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left on the two lane residential road and its front was struck by the front left of Vehicle #2.  Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage.      Vehicle #1 was driven by a 48-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags and not injured in the crash.  She stated that the other vehicle slowed down and she assumed it was stopping at the intersection.  She drove the road monthly but felt the intersection was somewhat confusing.  ",

The trailer remained on the road and came to rest facing southwest.  The Corolla (V2) rotated clockwise and came to rest just off the south side of the road facing southwest.    Vehicle #1 was driven by a 25-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags and not injured in the crash.    She stated that she began to decelerate as she approached because the other vehicle appeared to be easing out into the intersection.  However, she didn't believe the Corolla (V2) would continue because of lack of gap distance.  Once she realized Vehicle #2 was beginning to turn she applied her brakes, honked the horn and steered to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision.  ",

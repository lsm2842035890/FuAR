        "     The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane T-intersection.  Conditions were cloudy and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.  The westbound road had a posted speed limit of 50 MPH and the southbound road had a posted speed limit of 25 MPH and was controlled by a stop sign.     V1 was a 1985 Chevy Celebrity sedan traveling southbound in the right lane approaching a stop sign intending on turning left at the T-intersection.  V2, a 1995 Dodge Neon sedan, was traveling westbound in the right lane intending on continuing straight.  An unknown vehicle was traveling westbound on the same roadway and turned right onto the road where V1 originally was.  V1 then turned left and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane.  Both vehicles then side-slapped left to right and came to final rest facing southwest.  ",
        "       This two-vehicle crash occurred during morning daylight hours on a curved, two-lane, t-intersection with no controls.  The road runs north and south at the location and has one lane in each direction.  The speed limit is 40 kph (25 mph) road surface level asphalt and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time.       Vehicle #1 (V1), a red 1998 Dodge Stratus 4-door, driven by a 21 year-old female was traveling southbound in lane one. Vehicle #2 (V 2) a 1996 Ford Bronco driven by a 43 year-old female was traveling northbound in lane one. V 1 initiated a left turn just before the intersection the front of V1 collided with left side of Vi.  The impact rotated V1 somewhat counterclockwise and pushed it back and V1 came to rest in the northbound lane facing generally southeast.  V1 was towed due to damage.  The V1 driver stated that she was on her way to get a key to a new apartment that she was planning to move into. She added that she was wearing sunglasses and had the V1 sun visor down, but did not see V2 because the sun glare was blinding her as she began to turn left. V 2  noticed V1 turning into her path and steered to the right but was not able to avoid the collision with V1.  After the impact, V2 came to rest a few meters to the north of the intersection in the original lane of travel against the curb facing generally north.  V2 was towed due to damage.  ",

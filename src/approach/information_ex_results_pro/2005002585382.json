    "description": "     The crash occurred on a two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 55 MPH (89 KPH).  The roadway was straight with a grade of -2.3%.  There was a black on yellow \"Y\" intersection warning sign for both vehicles.  The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash.       Vehicle #1, a 1997 Plymouth Neon, was traveling north on the two lane roadway approaching the intersection.  Vehicle #2, a 1987 Ford F-350 stake body, was stopped facing north waiting to make a left hand turn.  Vehicle #1 struck Vehicle #2 in rear with front.  Both vehicles came to rest facing north.  Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage.  Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests."
